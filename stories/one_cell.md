# One Cell

## One

The phone woke Jeff at 5:47 in the morning.

He reached for it in the dark, knocking over the glass of water on his nightstand. The cold splash barely registered as he squinted at the screen. The number wasn't saved in his contacts, but he recognized the area code. Their old neighborhood.

"Hello?"

"Jeff." The voice came through rough, like gravel sliding down a slope. "It's Josh."

Jeff sat up. His brother's name hit him harder than the water soaking into the sheets. He couldn't remember the last time they'd spoken. Five years? Six?

"Josh," he said.

"Yeah." A pause. Background noise filtered through the line—traffic, maybe, or wind. "I know it's early."

"It's fine. Are you okay?"

"I've been thinking about some things." Josh's voice carried something Jeff couldn't quite identify. Not fear exactly. Resignation, maybe. "I wanted to call before—" He stopped. "I wanted you to know I don't blame you."

"Blame me for what?"

"For Mom sending me to live with Uncle Tommy. I know you didn't have anything to do with that. She made that call on her own."

Jeff's throat tightened. "Josh, that was twenty-seven years ago."

"I know." Another pause. "But I wanted you to know anyway. You were a good brother. The best brother. You always protected me when we were kids."

"You don't need to—"

"I've been thinking a lot lately about the one cell," Josh said. His words came faster now, tumbling over each other. "You remember? How Ms. Peterson told us that identical twins come from one cell that splits? I've been thinking about that. About how we used to be the same thing before......we drifted."

Jeff didn't know what to say. His brother sounded strange. Distant but urgent at the same time.

"Josh, where are you?"

"Doesn't matter." The sound of wind grew louder. "I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you. For any of it. You were always the strong one. I was always the scared one. Until—" He stopped again. "Until I wasn't."

"What's going on? Are you in trouble?"

"Nothing you need to worry about." Josh's voice softened. "Take care of yourself, Jeff. And remember what I said. About the one cell."

"Josh, wait—"

The line went dead.

Jeff sat in the dark holding his phone, water dripping from his nightstand onto the hardwood floor. The room felt colder than it had a few minutes ago. He tried calling back, but it went straight to voicemail. He tried again. Same result.

He got up and walked to the window. Outside, the suburban landscape stretched out in orderly rows of identical houses, each one dark except for the occasional porch light. His neighborhood looked nothing like the one where he and Josh had grown up. He'd worked hard to make sure of that.

The call didn't make sense. Josh sounded like he was saying goodbye, but that was ridiculous. His brother was thirty-eight years old, not some kid making a dramatic gesture. Still, something in his voice had been wrong. Final.

Jeff tried the number again. Voicemail.

He showered and dressed, though it was still before six. His wife, Caroline, slept through the noise. She had a gift for that—sleeping through anything. Their daughter Emma's room was dark as he passed it in the hall. She'd be up in an hour for school.

He made coffee and sat at the kitchen table with his phone in front of him. Every few minutes he picked it up and tried Josh's number again. Nothing.

By seven he was pacing. By eight, when he should have been heading to his engineering firm downtown, he was trying to figure out where Josh might be. He googled the number Josh had called from but found nothing - just a generic carrier message about privacy settings. The old neighborhood still pulled at the edges of his thoughts though. If Josh was in trouble, that's where it would have started.

He hadn't been back there in fifteen years.

Caroline found him at the kitchen table when she came down at eight-thirty. She wore her hospital scrubs—she was a surgical nurse and had a shift starting at ten.

"You're still here," she said.

"Josh called this morning."

She stopped halfway to the coffee maker. "Josh? Your brother Josh?"

"Yeah."

"When was the last time you talked to him?"

"I don't know. Maybe six, seven years ago. Last time he was arrested."

Caroline poured her coffee slowly. They'd been married twelve years and she knew better than to push when he got quiet like this. She waited.

"He called to tell me he doesn't blame me for our mother sending him away," Jeff said. "And he kept talking about this thing we learned in school. About how identical twins come from one cell."

"That's strange."

"He sounded like he was saying goodbye."

Caroline sat down across from him. "Did he say he was going to hurt himself?"

"No. Nothing like that. But something was off." Jeff looked at his phone again. "I keep trying to call back but it goes straight to voicemail."

"Maybe his battery died."

"Maybe."

They sat in silence for a moment. Emma's footsteps creaked overhead as she got ready for school.

"What are you going to do," Caroline asked.

"I don't know. Probably nothing. He's a grown man. If he needed help he'd ask for it."

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't true. Josh wouldn't ask for help. He never had. Not when they were kids and not now.

Caroline reached across the table and squeezed his hand. "You should at least try to find out if he's okay. You'll worry about it otherwise."

She was right. He would worry. He was already worrying.

"I'll make some calls," he said.

After Caroline and Emma left, Jeff sat alone in the too-quiet house. He didn't know who to call. He didn't have Josh's address. Didn't know where he worked or who his friends were. The only connection he had was Uncle Tommy.

He hadn't spoken to Tommy in even longer than Josh. Not since their mother's funeral eight years ago. Tommy had shown up drunk and left early. Jeff remembered standing by the grave watching his uncle weave his way back to a rusted Cadillac, Josh walking beside him with his hands in his pockets.

Finding Tommy's number took twenty minutes of searching through old contacts and finally calling his cousin Rachel, who still lived in the old neighborhood. She gave him the number and a warning.

"He's not doing great," she said. "The drinking's gotten worse."

"I just need to ask him about Josh."

"Josh is in trouble?"

"I don't know. Maybe. He called me this morning and said some weird things."

Rachel was quiet for a moment. "Be careful, Jeff. That whole world—it's not like when we were kids. It's gotten uglier."

"I'm just making a phone call."

"Sure," she said, but she didn't sound convinced.

Jeff dialed Tommy's number. It rang six times before someone picked up.

"Yeah." The voice was phlegmy and irritated.

"Uncle Tommy? It's Jeff. Jeff Conroy."

Silence. Then, "Jesus Christ. What do you want?"

"I'm looking for Josh. He called me this morning and now I can't reach him. I thought you might know where he is."

More silence. Jeff heard Tommy breathing on the other end, wet and labored.

"You don't know," Tommy said finally.

"Don't know what?"

"Josh is dead. Cops found him this morning in an alley off Buchanan Street. Shot twice in the head."

The kitchen tilted. Jeff gripped the edge of the table.

"What?"

"Your brother's dead. They called me an hour ago to identify the body." Tommy's voice was flat, emptied out. "Funeral's probably going to be Friday. I'll text you the details."

"Wait—"

But Tommy had already hung up.

Jeff sat at the table holding his phone. The coffee maker gurgled in the corner. Outside, a neighbor's dog barked. Normal sounds in a normal morning, but nothing felt normal anymore.

Josh had called him at 5:47 to say goodbye.

His brother had known he was going to die.

## Two

The funeral home sat on a corner lot across the street from Paisano's Pizzeria. Paisano's had been THE hangout when Josh and Jeff were teenagers. Jeff pulled into the cracked parking lot and sat for a moment looking at the immaculate white paint on the building's facade. It stood in sharp contrast to the peeling paint of the neighboring buildings. A hand-painted sign above the door read 'Amos Breslin Funeral Home' in faded gold letters.

He'd told Caroline he was going alone. She'd offered to come, offered to bring Emma, but he'd declined. This wasn't the kind of neighborhood where he wanted his family. Rachel's warning still echoed in his head.

The lot held maybe a dozen cars, most of them at least ten years old. A rusted Cadillac sat near the entrance. Uncle Tommy's car, still running after all these years.

Jeff got out and straightened his tie. He wore the same dark suit he'd worn to his mother's funeral eight years ago. It fit a little tighter now around the middle.

Inside, the funeral home smelled like lilies and old carpet. A woman in a black dress paused when she saw Jeff, taken aback by his resemblance to the departed. When she regained her composure, she gestured toward a room at the end of the hall. He could hear voices—not many, but enough to make him hesitate at the doorway.

The casket sat at the far end of the room, closed. Jeff felt a small relief at that. He wasn't sure he wanted to see his brother's face again after all these years, especially not like this.

Maybe fifteen people scattered among the folding chairs. Jeff recognized a few faces from the old neighborhood—people who'd aged badly, their features weathered by lives he'd worked hard to escape. Uncle Tommy stood near the casket talking to a woman Jeff didn't know. His uncle had aged too. The man who'd seemed imposing in Jeff's childhood now looked shrunken, his suit hanging loose on his frame.

Tommy saw him and stopped mid-sentence. The woman followed his gaze, then excused herself quietly.

"Didn't think you'd show," Tommy said as Jeff approached.

"He was my brother."

"Yeah." Tommy's eyes were red-rimmed but dry. "I suppose that's true."

They stood in uncomfortable silence. Up close, Jeff could smell the whiskey on his uncle's breath. Not fresh—probably from last night—but still lingering.

"Who found him," Jeff asked.

"Couple of kids cutting through the alley on their way to school." Tommy's voice was flat, mechanical. "Cops said he'd been dead a couple of hours by then."

He'd died not long after the phone call. Josh had known exactly what was coming.

"Do they know who did it?"

Tommy gave him a look. "You really want to talk about this here?"

"I do. I want to know what happened to my brother."

"Your brother got himself killed doing what he did. That's what happened." Tommy turned back toward the casket. "You been gone a long time, Jeff. You don't remember how things work anymore."

"Then tell me."

Tommy shook his head. "Later. After. Come find me after and we'll talk."

A priest Jeff didn't recognize entered the room and began organizing papers at a small podium. People started taking their seats. Jeff found a chair in the back row while Tommy moved to the front.

The service was brief. The priest clearly hadn't known Josh—his eulogy consisted of generic platitudes about a life taken too soon and God's mysterious plans. A few people got up to speak. One woman talked about Josh helping her move furniture last year. A man with a scar across his cheek mentioned that Josh had been a good friend, always there when you needed him.

Nobody mentioned what Josh had done for a living. Nobody talked about Uncle Tommy or the life Josh had led between leaving home at eleven and reaching adulthood. It was as if those years had been carefully edited out of existence.

Jeff watched his uncle sit rigid in the front row, staring at the casket. Tommy didn't cry. Didn't speak. Just sat there with his hands folded in his lap.

When it ended, people filed past the casket. Jeff joined the line, moving slowly toward the front. When his turn came, he stood looking at the polished wood surface and tried to remember the last time he'd actually seen Josh's face. That court appearance six years ago? Seven? His brother had looked tired then, worn down by a life that had been grinding at him since childhood.

"I'm sorry," Jeff said quietly. He didn't know if he was apologizing for not being there or for something else entirely.

Behind him, someone cleared their throat. Jeff moved on.

Outside, the afternoon sun felt too bright after the dim funeral home. Jeff loosened his tie and looked for Tommy. His uncle stood by the Cadillac smoking a cigarette and talking to two men Jeff didn't recognize. When he saw Jeff approaching, he said something to the men and they drifted away.

"You still want to talk," Tommy asked.

"Yes."

Tommy took a long drag on his cigarette and flicked the ash onto the pavement. "Get in the car. We'll go somewhere quieter."

Jeff hesitated. Getting in his uncle's car could be the first step on a dangerous path. But he got in anyway.

As Tommy fired up the engine, the smell of frying chicken emanating from the engine block mixed with the odor of stale cigarettes hanging in the air. Tommy drove without speaking, navigating streets Jeff half-remembered from childhood. They passed the Lawrence Bender elementary school he and Josh had attended—now surrounded by chain-link fence. The Git n Go where they'd bought candy and soda stood vacant with boarded up windows.

Tommy pulled into the parking lot of a dive bar called Mickey's. Even in the afternoon, a few cars sat outside.

"Seriously?" Jeff asked.

"You wanted to talk...and I need a drink." Tommy got out without waiting for a response.

Inside, the bar was dark and nearly empty. A bartender nodded at Tommy like he was a regular. Probably was. Tommy ordered a whiskey neat and looked at Jeff.

"Nothing for me," Jeff said.

They took a booth in the back. Tommy downed half his drink in one swallow and set the glass on the scarred table between them.

"Josh was doing collections," Tommy said without preamble. "Working for a guy named Viktor Petrov. You know what collections means?"

"Loan sharking."

"That and he collected from delinquent gamblers for Petrov's bookmakers." Tommy finished his drink and signaled for another. The bartender brought over the bottle and refilled Tommy's glass. "Josh was good at it. He could be persuasive without being violent. Most of the time, anyway."

"What happened?"

Tommy leaned back in the booth. "There was this woman. Single mother, two kids. She'd borrowed money for her kid's medical bills and fallen behind on payments. Viktor wanted Josh to lean on her. Make her understand that debt doesn't just go away."

Jeff waited.

"Josh paid the juice on her debt out of his own pocket," Tommy continued. "Not just once. Three, four times over the past six months. But, Viktor found out last week."

"And killed him for it?"

"Not Viktor himself...," Tommy stared into his glass. "But yeah. That's why Josh is dead. Cuz he couldn't get in line and just do the job."

The bar's jukebox played something country and mournful. Jeff felt the weight of it settling on him—his brother had died trying to protect someone. Just like he'd always done.

"The police know this?"

Tommy laughed, bitter and short. "The police don't give a shit about Josh Conroy. Small-time criminal gets shot in an alley? Case is already goin cold."

"So Viktor and whoever did the dirty work just walk away."

"That's how it works." Tommy met Jeff's eyes. "You should go home to your nice house and your nice family and forget about all this. Your brother made his choices. He knew the risks."

"He called me that morning. Before he died."

Something shifted in Tommy's expression. "What'd he say?"

"That he didn't blame me. For Mom sending him away." Jeff paused. "And he talked about us being twins. About how we came from one cell before we split."

Tommy was quiet for a long moment. "He talked about that sometimes. When he'd had too much to drink. About you being twins. About how different your lives turned out. And sometimes other things...about your dad." He finished his second drink. "No, he never blamed you. He was proud of you. He admired the example you set. I think it was something he tried to live up to."

"I should have stayed in touch."

"Maybe. Maybe not. It's too late now." Tommy stood up. "Come on. I'll drive you back to your car."

They drove in silence. When Tommy pulled into the funeral home parking lot, he kept the engine running.

"Go home, Jeff," he said. "There's nothing for you here anymore."

Jeff got out but leaned back in through the open door. "Who's Viktor Petrov? Where would I find him?"

Tommy's face hardened. "You're not listening."

"Josh was my brother."

Tommy looked carefully at Jeff for a moment before reaching under the front seat. "If you're going to keep pushing this, you should take this. It was Josh's. You might need it."

Jeff looked at Tommy's outstretched hand and saw he was holding a handgun out for Jeff to take.

"I don't think I'll need that," Jeff said. 

"If you're gonna keep askin around after Viktor, you just might. He keeps a low profile on purpose. You go messin that up, and you're gonna roust something. Mind you, I'm not endorsin that plan. I still think you should go home and leave it alone."

Jeff reached out and took the gun. It was lighter than he expected. After he took it, Tommy abruptly shut the door and unceremoniously drove away.

Jeff stood in the parking lot watching the Cadillac pull away. The sun was lower now, throwing long shadows across the cracked pavement. His phone buzzed in his pocket. A text from Caroline asking how it went.

He didn't reply. Instead, he got in his car and sat there thinking about Josh paying a stranger's debt over and over until it killed him. About his brother calling to say goodbye because he knew what was coming and accepted it.

About the one cell they'd come from before splitting into two very different people.

Jeff pulled out his phone and searched for Viktor Petrov. Nothing came up except a few social media profiles that looked like dead ends. He tried searching for loan sharks in the old neighborhood. That was useless too.

He needed someone who knew the neighborhood. Someone still connected to that world but willing to talk. His cousin Rachel had lived there her whole life. She'd know people.

Jeff pulled up her number and called.

"Hey," she said, surprised. "How was the funeral?"

"Sad. Short." He paused. "Rachel, I need to ask you something. Do you know anyone named Viktor Petrov?"

The line went quiet.

"Rachel?"

"Why are you asking about Viktor?" Her voice had changed, become careful.

"Tommy said Josh was working for him. That's why he got killed."

"Jeff, you need to leave this alone."

"I can't."

"Yes, you can. You absolutely can." Rachel's voice rose slightly. "Viktor Petrov is not someone you want to mess with. He's a monster, Jeff. A real monster. People don't cross him and live to talk about it."

"I'm not trying to cross him. I just want to understand what happened."

"Josh understood what happened. He made a choice and he paid for it. That's all you need to know."

"Rachel—"

"No. I'm serious. Go home to Caroline and Emma. Remember Josh however you want to remember him. But do not go looking for Viktor Petrov." She hung up.

Jeff sat in his car as the sun continued its descent. The funeral home was dark now, everyone gone. Just him alone in a parking lot in a neighborhood he'd spent half his life trying to forget.

He should listen to Tommy. To Rachel. Go home and let the police handle it, even if they never did.

But Josh had called him that morning for a reason. Had talked about the one cell, about being brothers, about protection. Josh had known he was going to die and had wanted Jeff to know something. What exactly, Jeff wasn't sure yet.

He started the car and drove home. But he didn't stop thinking about Viktor Petrov.

## Three

Jeff made it two days before going back.

He'd tried to focus on work. Sat through meetings about load calculations and structural integrity while his mind drifted to alleyways and closed caskets. Caroline asked him twice if he was okay. He told her he was fine.

On Wednesday afternoon, he left the office early and drove south toward the old neighborhood. He told himself he was just looking around. Seeing how things had changed. He didn't have a plan.

The Git n Go sat boarded up like a headstone. He drove past it slowly, taking in the changes. Some buildings had been torn down. Others had new paint and new purposes. On the corner where John Scali's barber shop used to be, a small restaurant called Lacona's had taken its place.

Jeff recognized the name. Mrs. Lacona had run a diner two blocks over when he was a kid. He and Josh used to go there after school sometimes. She'd give them free sodas if they were polite.

He pulled into the lot and went inside.

The restaurant was small, maybe a dozen tables, half of them occupied by the lunch crowd. The smell of frying onions and coffee filled the air. A younger woman—maybe thirty—worked the counter, but Jeff saw Mrs. Lacona emerge from the kitchen carrying two plates.

She'd aged. Her dark hair had gone gray and she moved more slowly than he remembered. But her face was the same. She set the plates down at a table near the window and turned to head back to the kitchen. Then she saw him.

She stopped. Stared. Her hand went to her chest.

Jeff raised a hand in a small wave. After a moment, she walked over.

"Sit anywhere," she said quietly. "I'll be with you in a minute."

He took a booth by the window facing the parking lot. The younger woman brought him water and a menu. He ordered an Italian beef sandwich he didn't particularly want and waited.

Mrs. Lacona came to his table five minutes later. She slid into the seat across from him without asking.

"I thought you were Josh," she said. "For just a second, I thought—" She shook her head. "I heard about what happened. I'm sorry."

"Thank you."

"Jeff, right? You're Jeff."

"Yes, ma'am."

She smiled, sad and tired. "You don't have to call me ma'am. You're not eleven anymore." She folded her hands on the table. "I went to the service. I saw you there, but you left quickly."

"I don't know many people anymore."

"No, I suppose you wouldn't." She looked at him carefully. "What are you doing back here?"

"I wanted to see the old neighborhood."

"That's not why you came into my restaurant."

He didn't have a good lie ready. "Josh called me the morning he died. He said some things that didn't make sense... I'm just trying to understand."

Mrs. Lacona was quiet for a moment. "Your brother was a regular here. He came in about a week before he died. Sat right where you're sitting now. He asked me if I remembered the day your father died."

Jeff's throat tightened. "What did you tell him?"

"I told him the truth. That I saw him that day, walking past the old diner just before lunchtime. He should have been in school, but he was alone." She paused. "He seemed relieved when I said that. Like it was important that someone else remembered."

"Did he say why he was asking?"

"No. But he looked troubled. More than usual." Mrs. Lacona's voice softened. "Your brother had a hard life, Jeff. Everyone knew it. He tried to do good sometimes, but the world he lived in didn't make that easy."

The younger woman brought Jeff's sandwich. Mrs. Lacona waited until she'd left before continuing.

"The police came by after Josh died. Asked if I knew anything. I told them I didn't." She met his eyes. "I didn't lie. I don't know who killed him. But I told them the same thing I'm telling you. Josh was asking about old times. About your father."

"Why are you telling me this?"

Mrs. Lacona reached across the table and patted his hand. "Because you were good boys. Both of you. You deserved better than what you got." She stood up slowly. "Be careful, Jeff. Whatever you're looking for, it might not be what you want to find."

She went back to the kitchen. Jeff sat alone with his sandwich, not eating. Josh had been asking about their father's death. About being seen that day. Why would that matter twenty-seven years later?

Jeff pulled out his phone and searched for the address of Lawrence Bender Elementary. It was still there, still operating despite the chain-link fence and the neighborhood's decline. He drove the six blocks and parked across the street.

The building looked smaller than he remembered. Most things did. The brick facade had darkened with age and the playground equipment had been updated, but the basic shape remained the same. He and Josh had spent six years inside those walls.

The day their father died, the boys walked to school together. But they weren't both there all day. Mrs. Lacona had seen Josh walking away from the school that morning. Their mother had been at work. Their father, who worked nights, was home asleep when someone entered their house and stabbed him in his bed with a knife from their kitchen.

Jeff's phone rang. Caroline.

"Hey," he said.

"Where are you? Emma's soccer practice ended ten minutes ago."

He'd forgotten. Completely forgotten. "I'm sorry. I got caught up with something. Can you pick her up?"

Silence on the other end. Then, "I'm at the hospital, Jeff. That's why you were supposed to get her."

"Right. I'm sorry. I'll go now."

"Where are you?"

He looked at the elementary school. At the chain-link fence and the darkened brick. "Running errands. I'll get Emma. I'm sorry."

He hung up before she could ask more questions. The soccer field was thirty minutes away if traffic was light. He'd be late, but not terribly late.

As he pulled away from the school, he glanced in the rearview mirror. A man stood on the corner near the playground, watching him. Jeff couldn't make out the details from this distance, but something about the way the man stood, stock—still and focused—made his hands tighten on the wheel.

He turned the corner and the man disappeared from view.

Jeff picked up Emma thirty minutes later. She sat on the bleachers with her coach, both of them looking annoyed. He apologized to them both. Emma didn't speak to him on the drive home.

"I said I was sorry," he told her.

"You forgot about me."

"I didn't forget about you. I just lost track of time."

She stared out the window. She was twelve and getting better at silence as a weapon. She'd learned it from him, probably.

At home, Caroline was already making dinner. She gave him a look that said they'd talk about this later. Emma went straight to her room.

Jeff helped with dinner in silence. Set the table. Poured drinks. Normal movements in a normal evening, but nothing felt normal. His mind kept going back to Mrs. Lacona. To Josh asking about their father. To the man on the corner watching him drive away.

After dinner, after Emma had gone to bed, Caroline found him on the back porch.

"What's going on with you," she asked.

"Nothing. I'm fine."

"You forgot to pick up our daughter. You're never late for her. Not ever."

He didn't have a good answer. Or he had one, but he couldn't say it. That he'd been sitting outside their old elementary school trying to put together puzzle pieces that just didn't quite fit.

"I'm sorry," he said. "It won't happen again."

Caroline sat down next to him. "This is about Josh, isn't it?"

His silence was all the answer she needed.

"I know you're grieving. But you can't let it pull you away from us." She took his hand. "Emma needs you here. I need you here."

"I am here."

"Are you?"

He didn't answer. They sat in silence listening to crickets and distant traffic. After a while, Caroline went inside. Jeff stayed on the porch looking at nothing.

His phone buzzed. A text from a number he didn't recognize.

"Stop asking questions."

That was all it said. No name. No context. Just four words.

Jeff stared at the message. He'd only talked to Mrs. Lacona. And she wouldn't have told anyone. Would she?

He thought about the man on the corner. About being watched.

Another text came through.

"You don't want to end up like your brother."

Jeff deleted both messages and went inside. He locked the doors. Checked the windows. Caroline was already asleep. He lay in bed next to her, staring at the ceiling.

He should stop. Go back to his life. Let Josh rest.

But Josh had called him that morning for a reason. Had talked about the one cell. About being brothers. About protection.

And now someone was threatening him for asking questions.

Jeff closed his eyes but didn't sleep.

## Four

The next morning, Jeff called his assistant to tell her he wouldn't be in. She didn't question it.

Caroline had already left for an early shift when he got up. Emma was at a friend's house for the night. The empty house felt like permission.

He made coffee and sat at the kitchen table with his laptop. The threatening texts had been deleted, but he remembered every word. Someone was watching him. Someone knew he'd been asking questions.

Good.

He needed to find someone who'd known Josh. Someone who'd worked with him. But he didn't have names, didn't know where to start.

He called Rachel.

"Jeff, it's seven in the morning," she said, groggy.

"I need a favor."

Silence. Then, "I told you to leave this alone."

"I can't. Someone threatened me last night. Told me to stop asking questions."

"Jesus, Jeff." He heard her moving, probably sitting up in bed. "That's exactly why you need to stop."

"Who would Josh have worked with? Someone close to him. Someone who'd know about Viktor."

"I'm not helping you get yourself killed."

"Rachel, please. Just a name. That's all I'm asking."

She was quiet for a long time. "There's a guy named Sean Delahunt. He and Josh ran together sometimes. He drinks at that bar on Maple, the one with the shamrock sign."

"Mickey's?"

"Yeah. How'd you know?"

"Lucky guess." Jeff paused. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. If you get yourself killed, I'm going to feel responsible." She hung up.

Jeff looked up Sean Delahunt. Found a couple of arrest records going back fifteen years. Petty theft, assault, possession. Nothing recent. Either he'd cleaned up or gotten better at not getting caught.

The bar wouldn't be open until noon. Jeff had a few hours to kill.

He spent them reading about Viktor Petrov. Not much online—the man kept a low profile. A few mentions in local news articles about loan sharking operations, always as an unnamed associate. One article from three years ago mentioned a Viktor Petrov being questioned in connection with a missing bookkeeper. No charges filed.

At eleven-thirty, Jeff got in his car and drove south.

Mickey's looked worse in daylight. The paint was peeling, the parking lot full of potholes. Only two cars sat outside. Jeff parked and went in.

The interior was dark despite the afternoon sun. It took a moment for his eyes to adjust. A bartender—different from the one who'd served Tommy—stood behind the bar wiping glasses. Two men sat at separate tables, both nursing beers.

"We just opened," the bartender said. "Kitchen's not running yet."

"That's fine. Just a beer." Jeff sat at the bar. "Whatever's on tap."

The bartender poured him something amber and set it down. Jeff paid in cash.

"I'm looking for Sean Delahunt," he said.

The bartender's expression didn't change, but something shifted in his posture. "Don't know him."

"He drinks here. My cousin told me."

"Your cousin's wrong." The bartender went back to wiping glasses.

Jeff sipped his beer. It was terrible. He waited.

After ten minutes, one of the men at the tables got up and left. The other stayed, watching Jeff in the mirror behind the bar. He was about Jeff's age, heavy-set, with thinning hair and a nose that had been broken more than once.

Jeff caught his eye in the mirror. "You Sean Delahunt?"

The man didn't answer. Just kept watching.

Jeff turned on his stool to face him. "I'm Jeff Conroy. Josh's brother."

"I know who you are," Sean said. His voice was rough, worn down by cigarettes or years or both. "You look just like him."

"Can I buy you a drink?"

Sean studied him for a long moment. Then he nodded at the empty chair across from him.

Jeff brought his beer over and sat down. Up close, Sean looked older. His hands shook slightly as he lifted his glass.

"I'm sorry about Josh," Sean said. "He was a good guy. Didn't deserve what he got."

"What did he get?"

"You don't know?"

"I know he's dead. I know Viktor Petrov is responsible. I want to know why."

Sean shook his head. "You shouldn't be asking about that."

"So I've been told." Jeff leaned forward. "But I'm asking anyway."

Sean drank the rest of his beer in one long swallow and signaled the bartender for another. When it came, he took a long pull before speaking.

"Josh and I did collections together. Worked for Viktor for about two years. It was good money, you know? Not great, but steady. Viktor had a route—people who borrowed, people who gambled, people who owed. We'd make the rounds, collect what was due, rough up anyone who got too far behind."

"Josh didn't seem like the type to rough people up."

"He wasn't. That was mostly me." Sean held up his right hand. Three fingers were normal. The pinky and ring finger were shorter, ending at the first knuckle. "When I screwed up, Viktor made sure I remembered. Josh was smarter. He talked to people. Convinced them. Most of the time it worked."

Jeff's stomach turned. "What happened when it didn't work?"

"Then I'd step in." Sean looked at his mangled hand. "Josh hated that part. He'd try every way he could to get people to pay before it came to that."

"Tell me about the woman. The single mother."

Sean's expression darkened. "Sophie Martinez. Two kids, seven and nine. Her youngest needed some kind of surgery. She borrowed five grand from one of Viktor's guys. Couldn't keep up with the juice."

"Josh paid it for her."

"Yeah. First time, Viktor didn't notice. But Josh kept doing it. Every week, he'd pay Sophie's vig out of his own pocket. Figured Viktor wouldn't know the difference." Sean shook his head. "But Viktor knows everything. He's got eyes everywhere. When he found out, he called Josh in."

"What happened?"

"Josh told him to go to hell. Said he wasn't going to squeeze a woman who was just trying to save her kid." Sean finished his second beer. "Viktor doesn't accept that kind of disrespect. You work for him, you do what he says. No exceptions."

"So he had Josh killed."

"Not right away. First he sent me to talk to Josh. Tell him to get back in line. But Josh wouldn't listen." Sean's voice got quieter. "He said he was done. Done with all of it. He told me he'd been thinking about his brother. About how different your lives turned out. Said maybe it wasn't too late for him to be different too."

Jeff felt something tighten in his chest. "When was this?"

"About two weeks before he died." Sean met his eyes. "He asked about you. Wanted to know if I thought you'd want to hear from him after all these years."

"What did you tell him?"

"I told him family's family. That blood matters, even when everything else is shit." Sean looked away. "I didn't know he was going to call you that morning. Didn't know Viktor had already put out the order."

"Who killed him?"

Sean shook his head. "I can't tell you that."

"Can't or won't?"

"Both." Sean stood up slowly. "Listen to me. Josh was my friend. One of the few good people I knew in this whole goddamn world. But he's gone now, and you going after Viktor won't bring him back. It'll just get you killed too."

"I'm not afraid of Viktor."

"Then you're an idiot." Sean put a hand on Jeff's shoulder. "Josh talked about you like you were something special. Like you were a goddamn superhero who could take on the the whole world. But, this ain't a comic book. In the real world, guys like Viktor always win. Don't get yourself killed just because you're angry."

"I'm not angry. I'm—" Jeff stopped. He didn't know what he was.

"Yeah, you are. I can see it." Sean squeezed his shoulder once and let go. "Go home, Jeff. Take care of your family. Let Josh rest."

Sean walked out of the bar, leaving Jeff alone with his shitty beer and the bartender who was definitely listening to every word.

Jeff sat there for another ten minutes before getting up and walking out the door.

In his car, he pulled out his phone. He had Sophie Martinez's name now. A real person Josh had died protecting. He could find her, talk to her, understand what had been so important that his brother had chosen death over compliance.

But Sean's words echoed in his head. Go home. Take care of your family. Let Josh rest.

Jeff started the car but didn't drive anywhere. Just sat in the parking lot watching Mickey's front door. After a while, a black sedan pulled up. Two men got out and went inside. They didn't look like afternoon drinkers.

One of them looked familiar. Not someone Jeff knew, but someone he'd seen before. Recently.

It took him a moment to place it. The man who'd been watching him at the elementary school. Same build, same way of moving. Deliberate. Focused.

Jeff's hands tightened on the steering wheel. They were following him. Or they'd followed Sean. Either way, Viktor knew he'd been here.

The men came out five minutes later. One of them looked directly at Jeff's car. Made eye contact. Smiled.

Then they got in their sedan and drove away.

Jeff sat there for another minute, his heart pounding. Then he pulled out his phone and called Caroline.

"Hey," she said. She sounded tired. "How are you feeling?"

"Better. Listen, I was thinking maybe we should take Emma somewhere this weekend. Get out of town for a few days."

"Jeff, I'm working all weekend. You know that."

"Right. I forgot." He hadn't forgotten. He just didn't want them here if things got dangerous. "Never mind."

"Are you sure you're okay? You sound strange."

"I'm fine. I'll see you tonight."

He hung up and sat staring at the empty parking lot. He should go home. Should let this go. But Josh's voice kept playing in his head. The one cell. Being brothers. Protection.

Josh had protected that woman. Had died to protect her. Trying to live up to some impossible standard.

He needed to find Sophie Martinez.

## Five

Finding Sophie Martinez turned out to be easier than Jeff expected. There were only three Sophie Martinezes in the area, and only one with children the right age.

She lived in a two-bedroom apartment on the eastern edge of the neighborhood. Not the worst part, but close. Jeff drove past it twice before parking half a block away. He needed to be careful. If Viktor's men were watching him, they might be watching her too.

The apartment building was red brick, four stories, with external stairs and a shared courtyard. Kids' toys littered the grass. A basketball hoop missing its net hung crooked over a parking space.

Jeff sat in his car for twenty minutes, watching. No black sedans. No men standing on corners. Just a woman coming home with groceries and two kids riding bikes in circles.

He got out and walked to the building. The directory by the front door listed S. Martinez in apartment 3B. No buzzer system—the front door was propped open with a brick.

Inside, the hallway smelled like stale cooking oil. Jeff took the stairs to the third floor and found 3B at the end of the corridor. He could hear a television through the door. Cartoons, probably.

He knocked.

Footsteps. The sound of a chain being fastened. Then the door opened a crack.

A woman in her early thirties looked out at him. Dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. Tired eyes. She wore scrubs—nurse or hospital tech, maybe.

"Can I help you?"

"Sophie Martinez?"

Her expression closed off immediately. "Who's asking?"

"My name is Jeff Conroy. As you can see, I'm Josh's brother."

She stared at him. "I didn't know Josh had a brother."

"He did. We weren't close. I hadn't seen him in years." Jeff kept his hands visible, non-threatening. "I'm trying to understand what happened to him."

"The police already came by. I told them I don't know anything."

"I'm not the police."

"Then you should go." She started to close the door.

"Please. Just five minutes. Josh died because of you, and I need to know why."

The door stopped. Sophie's face went pale. "What did you say?"

"Josh paid your debts. Viktor Petrov found out and had him killed for it." Jeff's voice was quiet. "I'm not blaming you. I just want to understand."

Sophie stood frozen for a moment. Then she unlatched the chain and opened the door wider. "Come in. But be quick. My kids will be home from school soon."

Jeff followed her into the small apartment. The living room was clean but worn. A couch with duct tape over one cushion. A TV on a stand. Children's drawings taped to the walls. Through an open doorway he could see a kitchen, dishes drying in a rack.

Sophie didn't sit. Just stood with her arms crossed. "I didn't know Josh was paying my debts. Not at first."

"When did you find out?"

"About a month ago. I asked the guy who came to collect why the amount kept staying the same. He told me someone was covering the interest." She looked away. "I figured it out. Josh was the only one who knew I was behind."

"How did you know Josh?"

"He came by every week. To collect." Sophie's voice was flat. "The first few times, he was all business. But then he found out my son is sick. He needed surgery. That's why I borrowed the money in the first place. Josh saw the medical bills on my table. After that, he started asking how my son was doing. If I needed anything."

"And you told him you couldn't pay?"

"I didn't have to tell him. He could see it." She sat down on the couch, suddenly looking exhausted. "I work two jobs. I pay what I can. But the interest—the juice—it never went down. I was drowning."

Jeff sat in the chair across from her. "Did Josh tell you he was paying it?"

"No. He just kept coming by, telling me everything was okay. That I had time." Sophie looked at him. "You look just like him. It's strange."

"We were twins."

"He mentioned that once. Said he had a brother who got out. Made something of himself." She smiled, sad. "He seemed proud of that."

Jeff felt the weight of it. Josh talking about him to a stranger. Proud.

"Why didn't you leave? After you found out Josh was paying?"

"Where would I go?" Sophie spread her hands. "I don't have money for a deposit on a new place. Don't have family who can take us in. This is it." She paused. "And I thought—I thought maybe Josh worked something out with Viktor. That it was okay."

"It wasn't okay."

"I know that now." Her voice cracked. "The morning after Josh died, two men came to my door. They told me my debt was cleared. Paid in full. Said Josh took care of it." She wiped her eyes. "They said I should remember that. Remember what it cost."

Jeff's hands tightened on the chair arms. "Did they threaten you?"

"They didn't have to. The message was clear. Josh paid my debt with his life, and I shouldn't talk about it."

They sat in silence. From somewhere in the building, Jeff could hear music playing. Someone laughing. Normal sounds of people living their lives, unaware of the violence that lurked at the edges.

"I'm sorry," Sophie said finally. "I'm sorry your brother died because of me."

"It wasn't because of you. It was because of Viktor. And maybe a little bit because of me."

"Does that make a difference?"

Jeff didn't have an answer for that.

A key turned in the lock. The front door opened and two kids came in—a girl maybe nine, a boy seven. They stopped when they saw Jeff.

"Mom?" the girl said.

Sophie stood up quickly, putting herself between Jeff and her children. "It's okay. This is Mr. Conroy. He's leaving."

Jeff stood too. He looked at the boy. Dark hair, big eyes. Still thin from being sick, probably. This was the kid Josh had died for. A seven-year-old who needed surgery.

"I should go," Jeff said.

He stopped and turned to face her one more time. "You know, I only made it out of this neighborhood because my mother married up when she re-married. By then, Josh was living with our uncle Tommy, so he stayed." 

Sophie walked him to the door. In the hallway, she spoke quietly. "Whatever you're planning to do about Viktor, don't. He'll kill you like he killed Josh."

"I'm not planning anything."

"Yes, you are. I can see it." She touched his arm. "Josh was a good man. I don't know what he did before he started helping me, but he was trying to be better. Don't waste your life on revenge."

"It's not revenge. It's—" Jeff stopped. He didn't know what it was.

Sophie shook her head. "Go home to your family, Mr. Conroy. That's what Josh would want."

She closed the door. Jeff heard the chain slide into place.

He stood in the hallway for a moment, then walked back to his car. The sun was setting, throwing long shadows across the parking lot. He got in and sat there, staring at Sophie's apartment building.

Josh had saved that woman and her kids. Had chosen them over his own life. And for what? So Sophie could keep living in a rundown apartment, working two jobs, barely scraping by?

No. Josh had done it because it was the right thing. Because someone needed protecting and he was there to do it.

Jeff's phone rang. Unknown number.

He almost didn't answer. But something made him pick up.

"Mr. Conroy." The voice was calm, measured. Faintly accented—Eastern European, maybe Russian. "I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time."

Jeff's hand tightened on the phone. "Who is this?"

"My name is Viktor Petrov. I believe you've been looking for me."

The parking lot seemed to tilt. Jeff forced himself to breathe normally. "Have I?"

"Please. Let's not insult each other's intelligence." Viktor's tone remained pleasant, almost friendly. "You've been asking questions. Talking to people. Mrs. Lacona. Sean Delahunt. And now Sophie Martinez. I admire your persistence."

"You've been watching me."

"Of course. You're driving a silver Honda Accord, license plate—well, I won't bore you with details you already know. You're parked half a block from Sophie's apartment building. You've been sitting there for three minutes now."

Jeff scanned the parking lot, the street. He didn't see anyone. No black sedan. No men on corners.

"What do you want?"

"The same thing you want, I think. To talk." Viktor paused. "Your brother was a good man, Mr. Conroy. Misguided, but good. I understand why you want to know what happened to him."

"You had him killed."

"I had him killed, yes." No hesitation. No attempt to deny it. "He made mistakes that left me no choice. Surely you understand that. You're an engineer, yes? You solve problems. Sometimes the solution is... unpleasant."

Jeff said nothing.

"I know about your life," Viktor continued. "Your wife Caroline, she's a surgical nurse. Your daughter Emma plays soccer. You live in a very nice neighborhood. You've built something good for yourself. Something clean. You should be proud."

The threat was there, wrapped in compliments. Jeff's throat went dry.

"Why are you calling me?"

"Because I think we can help each other avoid an unfortunate situation." Viktor's voice remained calm, reasonable. "You're not like your brother, Mr. Conroy. Josh was... emotional. He let his feelings cloud his judgment. But you—you're educated. Rational. And I think you understand how this world works even if you don't live in it anymore."

"I understand you murdered my brother."

"I understand you're grieving. That's natural. That's human." Viktor paused. "Come see me. Let's talk face to face. I think you'll find I'm not the monster you imagine."

"Where?"

"I have a social club on Harrison Street. Second floor, above the Golden Dragon restaurant. Do you know it?"

"I do."

"Good. Come tonight. Nine o'clock. Just you, of course. No police, no foolish gestures." The pleasantness in Viktor's voice sharpened slightly. "You strike me as a smart man, Mr. Conroy. Smart men know when to listen. Smart men protect what matters to them."

The line went dead.

Jeff sat holding his phone. His heart hammered in his chest. Viktor knew where he was. Knew about Caroline and Emma. Had been watching him this whole time.

He should go home. Should call the police. Should do anything except drive to Harrison Street at nine o'clock.

But Josh had called him that morning for a reason. Had talked about being brothers. Had reminded him about the one cell they'd come from before splitting into two different people.

And now Jeff understood what Josh had been trying to say.

They weren't different. Not really. They'd just taken different paths to the same place. Josh had aspired to spend his life protecting people, even when it cost him everything. Even when it killed him.

Now it was Jeff's turn.

He looked at the clock on his dashboard. 5:45. He had time to go home first. To see Caroline and Emma one more time before—

Before what?

Jeff started the car and drove toward his house. He needed to think. He needed a plan. And he needed to decide what he was willing to do when he walked into Viktor Petrov's office in less than four hours.

## Six

Jeff arrived home at six-fifteen. Caroline's car was in the driveway. The porch light was on. Everything looked normal.

He sat in the car for a moment, his mind drifting to Josh's gun in his glove compartment. He'd checked it before driving away from Sophie's apartment. He didn't know much about guns, but he knew enough. But life isn't a movie and taking a gun to a meeting with a man like Viktor would be beyond foolish for an ordinary joe.

Inside, Caroline was making dinner. Emma sat at the kitchen table doing homework. Normal. Peaceful.

"Hey," Caroline said when she saw him. "I was starting to worry."

"Sorry. Got caught up."

She looked at him carefully. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just tired."

Emma glanced up from her math worksheet. "Dad, can you help me with number seven?"

Jeff sat down next to her. The problem was about calculating the area of an irregular shape. Simple geometry. He walked her through it, his voice steady even though his mind was elsewhere.

After dinner, he helped clean up. Watched TV with Caroline and Emma for an hour. Went through all the motions of being present while part of him was already on Harrison Street.

At eight-thirty, he told Caroline he needed to run an errand.

"Now?" She frowned. "It's late."

"I know. I just—there's something I need to take care of."

She studied his face. "This is about Josh, isn't it?"

He didn't answer. He saw concern in her expression but also anger. Did she know more than she let on about what he'd been doing.

"Jeff, whatever you're doing, please be careful," she said tersely.

"I will." He kissed her forehead. "I love you."

"I love you too."

He went upstairs and looked in on Emma. She was in bed reading. He stood in the doorway watching her for a moment.

"Dad?" She looked up. "You okay?"

"Yeah. Just wanted to say goodnight."

"Goodnight."

"Love you, kiddo."

"Love you too. Sleep well tonight dad."

"I hope I will. You sleep well too."

Jeff closed her door and went back downstairs. Caroline was on the couch with her phone. She looked up as he headed for the door.

"Jeff."

He turned.

"Come home," she said quietly.

"I will."

He wasn't sure if she believed it.

---

Harrison Street was in the older commercial district, a few blocks from where Jeff had grown up. The Golden Dragon occupied the ground floor of a three-story brick building. Red and gold signs in the windows. A neon dragon that flickered.

Jeff parked across the street. Eight fifty-five.

He could still leave. Drive home. Call the police. Do the smart thing.

Instead, he got out of the car.

An exterior staircase ran up the side of the building. Second floor. A door at the top with no sign, just a number: 247. Light showed through the frosted glass window.

Jeff climbed the stairs. His hand found the gun in his pocket. He left it there.

He knocked.

Footsteps. The door opened.

A man stood there—mid-forties, muscular, wearing a dark suit. One of the men from the black sedan. He looked at Jeff without expression.

"Mr. Conroy. Come in."

Jeff stepped inside. The man patted him down professionally, found the gun, removed it.

"Arms at your sides, please."

The room was a waiting area. Worn furniture, a few chairs, a desk. Another door at the far end. The man gestured toward it.

"Mr. Petrov is expecting you."

Jeff walked to the door and opened it.

The office beyond was surprisingly ordinary. A desk. Filing cabinets. A window overlooking the street. Viktor Petrov sat behind the desk, reading something on a laptop. He looked up when Jeff entered.

He was younger than Jeff expected. Maybe fifty. Fit, well-dressed in a dark suit and crisp white shirt. Graying hair cut short. He had the face of a businessman, not a killer. Intelligent eyes that took in everything.

"Mr. Conroy." Viktor stood and extended his hand. "Thank you for coming."

Jeff didn't shake. Just stood there.

Viktor smiled slightly and gestured to a chair. "Please. Sit."

Jeff remained standing.

"As you wish." Viktor sat back down. "Can I offer you something? Coffee? Water?"

"No."

"Straight to business, then. I appreciate that." Viktor leaned back in his chair. "Your brother worked for me for two years. He was reliable. Effective. I paid him well. He had no complaints."

"Until he did."

"Yes. Until he did." Viktor's expression didn't change. "Sophie Martinez. A sad case, really. Two children, medical bills. She borrowed money she couldn't repay. These things happen."

"Josh paid her debts."

"Josh exceeded his authority." Viktor's voice remained calm. "He was an employee, Mr. Conroy. Not a charity. When you employ someone, you expect them to follow instructions. Surely you understand that."

"I understand you killed him for it."

"I removed a liability." Viktor folded his hands on his desk. "Josh made his choice. He knew the consequences. I gave him opportunities to correct his mistake. He refused."

Jeff's hand twitched toward his pocket, remembered the gun was gone.

Viktor noticed. Smiled slightly. "You brought a weapon. I expected that. You're grieving, angry. It's natural to want... resolution."

"You think I came here to kill you."

"Didn't you?"

Jeff didn't answer.

"Let me tell you something about your brother," Viktor said. "Josh was a good man in a bad situation. He wanted to do right. But he was weak. He let emotion guide him. That's why he's dead."

"He wasn't weak."

"No?" Viktor raised an eyebrow. "He threw away his life for a woman he barely knew. For children that weren't his. That's not strength, Mr. Conroy. That's sentiment."

"He was protecting someone who needed it."

"And what good did it do?" Viktor spread his hands. "Sophie still lives in that apartment. Still works two jobs. Still struggles. Josh accomplished nothing except getting himself killed."

"He saved her."

"For how long?" Viktor leaned forward. "She'll borrow again. She'll fall behind again. And next time, there won't be a Josh to help her. Your brother died for nothing."

Jeff felt something cold settle in his chest. "You really believe that."

"I know it." Viktor's voice was certain. "This is why you and I are different men, Mr. Conroy. You escaped. You built something. You're smart enough to know that sentiment is a luxury. Josh never learned that lesson."

"You think I'm like you."

"I think you understand reality better than your brother did." Viktor stood and walked to the window. "You've seen what I've built. An organization that works. Rules that are followed. Order. Your brother tried to insert chaos into that order. I couldn't allow it."

"So you had him executed."

"I removed a problem." Viktor turned back to face him. "And now you're here, believing you can do... what? Avenge him? Kill me? And then what, Mr. Conroy? You go home to your wife and daughter? You think there won't be consequences?"

"You threatening my family?"

"I'm explaining reality." Viktor moved back to his desk. "You walk out of here tonight, we never speak again. You forget about this. I forget about you. Your wife, your daughter—they stay safe. You keep your nice life. That's the smart choice."

"And if I don't make the smart choice?"

Viktor's expression hardened slightly. "Then you're as foolish as your brother. And you'll end up the same way."

They stood in silence. Jeff could hear the clock on the wall ticking. Traffic sounds from the street below.

"You really don't get it," Jeff said quietly.

"Get what?"

"Why I'm here."

Viktor smiled. "You're here because you're angry. You want justice for your brother. It's understandable. But understanding something and acting on it are different things."

"I'm here," Jeff said, "because twenty-seven years ago, someone killed our father. Stabbed him in his bed with a kitchen knife. Josh was eleven years old. So was I."

Viktor's smile faded slightly. "I'm aware of your family history."

"Are you?" Jeff took a step closer. 

"Everyone thought Josh did it," Viktor recounted. "He disappeared from school that day. Mrs. Lacona saw him leaving. The police questioned him. Your own mother believed he'd done it. That's why she sent him to live with her brother."

"That's the basic story, yes. That's why our lives split apart."

"I'm not sure what this has to do with—"

"Josh didn't kill our father," Jeff said. "I did."

The room went very still.

Viktor stared at him. "What?"

"I left school that morning. Walked home. My father was asleep. I took a knife from the kitchen and went upstairs." Jeff's voice was steady, almost clinical. "He didn't wake up until I was already stabbing him. He tried to fight back, but he was half-asleep, confused. I was eleven years old and I killed my father."

Viktor said nothing.

"Josh figured out what I was planning to do. When I disappeared from school that morning and pretended to be me. Sat in my desk. Answered to my name. Made sure everyone saw 'Jeff' at school that day."

"Why?" Viktor asked quietly.

"To protect me." Jeff's throat tightened. "Our father was a bully and a fiend. And Josh was his favorite target. Josh lived in fear every minute at home. I don't remember ever feeling afraid. Only seething hatred. I spent my childhood trying to draw my father's wrath away from Josh because I could take it. He couldn't." 

"Your brother took the blame for murder."

"Our mother never proved anything. Never went to the police with her suspicions. But she knew. Or thought she knew. She couldn't look at Josh anymore. Couldn't keep him in the house. So she sent him away." Jeff paused. "Josh spent twenty-seven years living with the consequences of protecting me. He never told anyone and made me promise I wouldn't either. Never blamed me. Not once."

Viktor sat down slowly. For the first time, he looked uncertain.

"He called me the morning he died," Jeff continued. "Talked about how we came from one cell before we split. About how identical twins start as one thing before becoming two. You know what he was telling me?"

Viktor didn't answer.

"That we were always the same person. That the only difference between us was circumstance. That he wasn't the weak one and I wasn't the strong one. We were both just trying to protect people." Jeff's voice was quiet. "You killed him because you thought he was weak. Because you thought sentiment was foolish. But you were wrong."

"Mr. Conroy—"

"You should have expected me to come here," Jeff said. "After all, we used to be one cell."

The door behind Jeff opened. The bodyguard stepped in, holding Josh's gun.

"Everything okay, boss?"

Viktor looked at Jeff for a long moment. Then he nodded at the gun.

"Give it back to him."

The bodyguard hesitated. "Sir?"

"Give Mr. Conroy his weapon and leave us."

"Boss, I don't think—"

"Now."

The bodyguard handed Jeff the gun and left, closing the door behind him.

Jeff stood there holding Josh's gun. Viktor sat behind his desk, watching him.

"So," Viktor said quietly. "What now?"

Jeff looked at the gun in his hand. It would be easy. One bullet. Maybe two. Viktor was unarmed. The bodyguard was outside, and by the time he came back, it would be over.

He thought about Josh calling him that morning. About the one cell. About protection.

Josh had spent his whole life protecting people. Had died doing it. 

Jeff raised the gun.

Viktor didn't flinch. Just watched him with those intelligent eyes.

"Your brother," Viktor said, "died trying to prove something. Died trying to be better than what he was. And for what?"

"He died because you couldn't tolerate someone trying to do right," Jeff said. "Couldn't stand that he cared more about a stranger's kid than your rules."

"And now you'll kill me? Become a murderer twice over?"

Jeff's finger rested on the trigger. Twenty-seven years. That's how long Josh had carried the weight of protecting him. That's how long his brother had lived as an outcast because of a choice Jeff had made.

And now Josh was dead. Shot twice in the head in an alley. Alone.

Jeff lowered the gun slightly.

"No," he said. "I'm not going to kill you."

Viktor's expression shifted. Something that might have been relief. Or contempt.

Jeff set the gun on Viktor's desk and turned to leave.

"That's it?" Viktor said behind him. "You came all this way just to tell me a story?"

Jeff stopped at the door. Looked back.

"I came here because my brother called me that morning for a reason. Because he reminded me about the one cell. Because he wanted me to understand something."

"What's that?"

"That protection matters. That doing right matters. Even when it costs everything." Jeff pulled out his phone. "Josh protected people with his body. With his life. But I'm an engineer. I solve problems differently."

He showed Viktor the screen. Sent emails. Time-stamped from the parking lot outside Sophie's apartment.

"Federal Bureau of Investigation. State Attorney General's Office. And a reporter at the Tribune who's been investigating loan sharking operations." Jeff's voice was calm. "Everything Josh told Uncle Tommy. Everything Sean Delahunt told me. Everything I found. Names. Addresses. Operations. Bank accounts. All of it."

Viktor went very still. His face drained of color.

"You can kill me," Jeff said. "But it won't matter. It's already done. They're probably reading it right now. Deciding which agency moves first. How many warrants to get." He paused. "Killing me just adds another murder charge when they come for you."

"You stupid—" Viktor lunged for the gun on his desk.

Jeff was faster. He grabbed Viktor's wrist, twisted hard. The gun clattered to the floor.

They struggled briefly. Viktor was strong, trained, but Jeff had twenty-seven years of rage behind him. All the guilt. All the grief. All of it.

He slammed Viktor against the wall. Held him there.

"Josh died protecting someone," Jeff said through gritted teeth. "I'm doing the same thing. Just smarter."

He let go. Viktor slid down the wall, gasping.

Jeff picked up Josh's gun and walked to the door. The bodyguard was there, hand on his weapon.

"Your boss needs you," Jeff said.

He walked past, down the stairs, across the street to his car. His hands were shaking. He sat behind the wheel, breathing hard.

His phone rang. Caroline.

"Hey," he said.

"You coming home?"

"Yeah. I'm coming home."

"Good." A pause. "Jeff?"

"Yeah?"

"I love you."

"I love you too."

He hung up and started the car. In the rearview mirror, he saw police cars turning onto Harrison Street, lights flashing.

Jeff drove away.

Three weeks later, Jeff stood at Josh's grave. The marker was simple: Joshua Thomas Conroy. Beloved Son and Brother.

Uncle Tommy had picked it out. Paid for it too, though he'd never said as much.

Jeff set down the flowers and knelt in the grass.

"They arrested Viktor yesterday," he said quietly. "Federal charges. Racketeering, conspiracy to commit murder. The reporter found other victims willing to testify. It's going to stick."

A breeze moved through the cemetery trees.

"Sophie and her kids are okay. I set up a fund for them. Anonymous. Her son's surgery went well. He's going to be fine."

Jeff touched the cold stone marker.

"I'm sorry I let you take the blame. I'm sorry I never told anyone. I'm sorry for all of it." His voice caught. "You spent your whole life protecting me, and I never thanked you."

He sat back on his heels.

"Caroline's pregnant. We just found out. If it's a boy, we're going to name him Joshua. I think you'd like that."

A car passed on the road beyond the cemetery.

"I don't know if I did the right thing. With Viktor. Maybe I should have just..." He trailed off. "But I wanted to try it your way. To protect people. Just smarter. The way you said I was."

Jeff stood up. Brushed off his pants.

"I'll come back soon. I promise." He paused. "We used to be one cell. Maybe we still are. Just in different ways."

He walked back to his car. As he drove out of the cemetery, he looked in the rearview mirror one last time at the grave.

His phone buzzed. A text from Caroline.

"Lunch at Lacona's? Emma wants Italian beef."

He smiled. Typed back: "See you there in twenty."

Jeff turned onto the main road and headed south, toward the old neighborhood. Toward his family. Toward whatever came next.

The one cell had split twenty-seven years ago into two different people who'd lived two different lives. But maybe Josh had been right. Maybe they'd always been the same. Just taking different paths to the same place.

Protecting people. Doing right. Even when it cost everything.

Jeff thought Josh would be proud of that.

He hoped so.
