# Prologue
**Wednesday October 19, 2011 4:00PM**

The Crossroads Mini-Mart sat at the intersection of County Road 400 and State Route 39, three miles south of Thorndale, Indiana. It was the kind of place that survived on lottery tickets, fountain drinks, and the handful of people who stopped for gas on their way to somewhere else. The building hadn't been updated since the early nineties—faded red brick, a hand-painted sign advertising "Live Bait & Tackle," and a payphone mounted on the exterior wall.

The black sedan pulled into the gravel lot at four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon in October. Two men climbed out. The air was cool and still, carrying the sweet-rot smell of harvested cornfields—that particular scent of October in the rural Midwest, somewhere between earth and decay. The first man, wearing pressed khakis and a navy button-down with the sleeves rolled precisely to mid-forearm, surveyed the property with the systematic attention of someone cataloging details. The second wore khakis that looked like they'd been slept in and a wrinkled gray oxford shirt untucked on one side. He stood by the passenger door for a long moment, staring at the building.

A sheriff's deputy leaned against his cruiser near the entrance, arms crossed. He straightened when he saw them approaching.

"You the FBI?" he asked.

The first man extended his hand. "Agent Ellis. This is Agent Gray."

The deputy shook Ellis's hand, then nodded at Gray, who had moved past them toward the building without acknowledging the introduction. "He always like that?"

"Usually," Ellis said. "You're Deputy...?"

"Kowalski. I was first on scene back in April." He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket and offered it. Ellis declined. "Sheriff said you wanted to see where it happened. Not much to see after six months later."

"We appreciate you meeting us." Ellis glanced back at Gray, who stood near the payphone, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as if listening to something. "Can you walk me through what we know?"

Kowalski unwrapped a piece of gum. "Victim was Sarah Carpenter. Twenty-two. Worked at the public library in town. Stopped here April sixteenth, around eight-fifteen in the evening. She'd just finished her shift." He gestured toward the building. "Witness was Travis Walton. He was inside getting cigarettes when it happened."
>COMMENT: Walton instead of Walton?

"They knew each other?"

"Small town. Everybody knows everybody. They weren't close, but he recognized her car in the lot." Kowalski pointed to a spot near the side of the building. "She parked over there. Security camera shows her walking to the payphone. Car wouldn't start, apparently, and she didn't have her cell. Left it at work, it was found at the library a few days later. She called AAA first before going inside to use the restroom, then came out to make another call while she waited."

Ellis looked at the payphone. Gray was closer to it now, standing maybe two feet away, still motionless. "The camera caught the abduction?"

"Partial. Camera's mounted above the door, faces the pumps and the front lot. Picks up the edge of where the phone is. We got her walking over, then about three minutes of her on the phone can be seen based on the shadows. Then a pickup truck drives through the frame-older model, can't see the plate—and parks right at the edge of the camera's view."

"But you see something."

"Movement. Most of it is just their shadows. Looks like someone gets out of the driver's side. Thirty seconds later, the truck pulls out. Heads south on 39. Sarah's gone. Her purse was still by the phone. Keys in her car."

"What was Walton doing during this?"

"Inside, like I said. Paying for cigarettes. He comes out maybe a minute after the truck leaves, sees her purse on the ground, no Sarah. Called 911 at eight-nineteen."

Ellis made a note on his phone. "Any leads on the truck?"

"Chevy Silverado. 10 to 15 years old based on the body style. Dark colored. We put out a BOLO, checked every registration in three counties. Found twenty-seven trucks that matched. Talked to every owner. Nothing stuck."

Gray had moved to the door of the mini-mart. He stood in the entrance, looking back toward where the payphone was mounted on the wall. The angle put the phone about thirty feet from the door, slightly around the corner of the building.

"And no trace of Sarah since?"

"Nothing. No activity on her bank cards, no sightings. It's like she vanished into thin air." Kowalski folded the gum wrapper into a small square. "Sheriff reopened it as a cold case last month. That's when he reached out to you guys."

Ellis thanked him and walked toward the mini-mart. Gray had gone inside. Through the window, Ellis could see him standing near the register, talking to the clerk—a heavyset man in his fifties wearing a Colts jersey.

"That's Marv," Kowalski said, following Ellis's gaze. "Owns the place. He was working that night too."

Inside, the store smelled like stale coffee and air freshener. A radio played country music at low volume. Gray stood with his back to the door, nodding as Marv spoke.

"—told the sheriff the same thing," Marv was saying. "Didn't see nothing. I was stocking the cooler in back when Travis came in. Rang him up, he left. Maybe ninety seconds total. By the time I looked out the window, that truck was gone."

"You didn't hear anything?" Gray asked. His voice was quiet, even.

"Like what?"

"A scream. A car door. Anything."

Marv shook his head. "Radio was on. And my hearing's not what it used to be."

Gray turned and walked past Ellis without a word, heading back outside. Ellis exchanged a look with Marv—apologetic, professional—and followed.

Outside, the afternoon light was starting to fade. Gray stood by the payphone again. He had taken his hands out of his pockets. His fingers brushed the metal surface of the phone's cradle.

"I need some time here," Gray said when Ellis approached.

"How long?"

"At least an hour. Maybe more."

Kowalski shifted his weight. "You want me to stick around?"

"No," Gray said bluntly. "I work better alone."

The deputy looked to Ellis, who nodded. "We'll call if we need anything. Thanks for your time."

After Kowalski drove off, Ellis walked back to the sedan and leaned against the hood. The sun hung low over the fields to the west, casting long shadows across the gravel lot. Gray stood motionless by the payphone, his hand resting on the receiver. From a distance, it looked like he might be making a call himself.

Ellis checked his watch. Four forty-seven. He pulled out his phone and opened the case file, scrolling through the details again. Witness statements. Security footage stills. The timeline. He'd read it all a dozen times on the drive down from Indianapolis.

When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.

Ellis knew better than to interrupt. He returned to the file, reading the same information he'd already memorized, waiting for whatever it was that Gray did in these moments.

The sun dropped lower. The temperature fell. Ellis grabbed his jacket from the car and put it on.

At six-fifteen, when the sky had gone purple and the security light above the mini-mart door had flickered on, Gray finally stood. He walked back to the car slowly, hands back in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Ellis asked.

Gray opened the passenger door but didn't get in. He stood there, looking back at the payphone.

"She knew him," Gray said.

"The abductor?"

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until it was too late."

Ellis waited, but Gray offered nothing else. He climbed into the car and closed the door.

They drove back to Thorndale in silence as the last light bled from the sky.

# Chapter One
**Wednesday Evening**

The Bluebird Diner sat on the corner of Main and Second in Thorndale, a chrome-sided relic from the fifties with cracked vinyl booths and a rotating pie case by the register. Matt pulled into the gravel parking lot at seven forty-five, following the hand-lettered sign that promised "Home Cooking & Cold Beer." The interior glowed warm yellow through the windows. Only three other cars in the lot—locals, probably, based on the Purdue and Indiana State decals in the back windows.

Brandon was already inside when Matt walked through the door. He'd taken a booth near the back, away from the handful of other customers scattered along the counter. A laminated menu sat untouched in front of him. He stared at the table surface like he was reading something written there.
>COMMENT: How did Brandon get here by himself before Gray. They only have one car right?

Matt slid into the opposite side of the booth. "You order yet?"

"No." Brandon looked up. His eyes had that unfocused quality they got after he spent time at a scene. "Waiting for you."

A waitress appeared—sixties, reading glasses on a chain, nametag that said Dottie. She pulled an order pad from her apron. "Coffee?"

"Please," Matt said. "And another Coke for him."

The glass was empty, but Matt had learned his patterns over the past three years. Coffee first thing in the morning and after midnight when they were working late. Coke any other time. Iced tea if he was trying to think through something complicated.

"We got meatloaf tonight," Dottie said. "Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. Chef's special."

Matt ordered the meatloaf. Brandon asked for a burger, no pickles. Dottie collected the menus and shuffled back toward the kitchen. 

Matt's fingers tapped out a steady rhythm on the table top in the silence that followed. Waiting to see if Brandon had anything to say.

"So," Matt said when she was out of earshot. "She knew him."

Brandon nodded. He picked up a sugar packet from the ceramic holder and turned it over in his fingers. "Not well. But familiar enough that she didn't panic when he approached."

"How familiar? Friend? Coworker? Someone she saw around town?"

"Somewhere in that range." Brandon set the sugar packet down. "She was surprised to see him there. That part didn't make sense to her."

Matt pulled out his phone and opened the case file. He'd downloaded everything the sheriff's office had sent over—witness statements, security footage stills, the initial investigation reports. "Kowalski said the camera caught her on the phone for about three minutes before the truck pulled in. Who was she calling?"

"Her mother. Telling her the car broke down and she'd be late getting home." Brandon paused. "AAA said forty-five minutes to an hour to get someone out. She wasn't worried. Just annoyed."

Matt scrolled through the file. The phone records confirmed it—one call to AAA at 8:12 PM, lasted two minutes. Second call to a number registered to Linda Carpenter at 8:14 PM, lasted three minutes. Third call placed at 8:17 PM to a number that belonged to someone named Jessica Holt.

"Who's Jessica Holt?"

"Friend from high school. Sarah was calling to see if Jessica could give her a ride home instead of waiting for the tow truck." Brandon's fingers drummed once against the table. "The call went to voicemail. Sarah was leaving a message when the truck arrived."

Matt made a note. "So she's mid-voicemail, not paying full attention. Someone pulls up in a truck. Someone she recognizes. He gets out, walks over. She's not alarmed because she knows him. Then what?"

"Then she realizes something's wrong."

"What makes her realize?"

Matt noticed the quiet tension that filled Brandon's face, his gaze drifting toward the window, where the last of the daylight had faded completely. "The way he was looking at her. The way he moved. She tried to end the call. Dropped the phone."

Dottie returned with their drinks. Matt thanked her. Brandon ignored his Coke.

"So we're looking for someone local," Matt said. "Someone Sarah would recognize on sight. Male. Drives or has access to a dark colored Chevy Silverado from the nineties."

"Mid-thirties to early fifties, probably. Based on the truck and the way he moved."

Matt looked up. "You got that from the security footage?"

"Partial. The way he got out of the truck, walked around to the passenger side. Confident but not young. Steady on his feet."

Matt had watched the same footage half a dozen times. The angle didn't quite catch the payphone, most if the action had take place right at the periphery. He could see movement, shadows, but nothing that told him about the suspect's age or gait. Brandon always saw more. Or claimed to.

"What else?" Matt asked.

"I'm pretty sure this wasn't opportunistic. That he knew she'd be there."

"How could he know that? The car breaking down was random."

Brandon shook his head. "The car didn't break down. He sabotaged it."

Matt set his phone on the table. "That wasn't in any of the reports."

"It wouldn't be. They towed her car to a lot in town, figured they'd deal with it later if Sarah turned up. After a few months they probably sold it for scrap or parts. But the timing's too convenient. Car that's been running fine suddenly won't start right as she's leaving work? He was watching. Waiting for the right moment. He did something to the engine or the battery while she was at the library."

"That's a big assumption."

"It's the only thing that makes sense." Brandon finally looked at his Coke but didn't drink it. "He knew her routine. Knew she'd stop at the Crossroads for gas on her way home. Knew she'd use the payphone if she didn't have her cell phone."

"Her cell phone?"

"It was missing when they found her purse. It was eventually found at the library but not until a week later. I think he stole it the day she disappeared and then planted it back at the library later."

Matt leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table. His hands slowly massaged his temples. Three years working with Brandon Gray, and he still couldn't pin down how his partner assembled these narratives. Sometimes it felt like guesswork elevated to an art form. Other times—most times—it turned out to be uncannily accurate.

"Okay," Matt said. "Let's say you're right. He tampered with her car. Swiped her phone. He's been planning this. Which means he's someone who had access to her car and her phone. Someone close enough to learn her routine."

"Or someone who's been watching her long enough to know it without being close."

"Stalker?"

"Possibly."

Dottie brought their food. The meatloaf came swimming in brown gravy, with real mashed potatoes—not the instant kind—and green beans that still had some snap to them. A basket of rolls arrived with actual butter, not the plastic packets. Brandon's burger was thick and hand-formed, cheese melted perfectly over the edges. The kind of food that justified a small town diner's existence.

"So where do we start?" Matt asked. "Coworkers at the library? Regular customers? Ex-boyfriends?"

"Start with people who drive that truck. Cross-reference with people who knew Sarah well enough to recognize but weren't in her close circle. Friends of friends. Parents of kids she went to school with. That age range."

Matt made notes. "Kowalski said they checked every nineties Silverado owner in three counties. Came up empty."

"They checked registered owners. Someone could be driving their father's truck. Their employer's truck. Borrowed it from a friend. And with a truck that old, it could be unregistered with stolen plates." Brandon picked up his burger, examined it, set it back down. "And they were looking for someone with an obvious connection to Sarah. We're looking for someone more tangential. Someone who'd blend in."

"That's half the town."

"Closer to a quarter. The truck narrows it. So does the age range. And the fact that he's comfortable committing a violent crime in a semi-public location." Brandon finally took a drink of his Coke. "I don't think he's done this before, but he's thought about it a lot. This act...it has meaning to him."

They ate in silence for a while. The diner had emptied out further. Just them and an older couple at the counter nursing coffee. A country song played from a speaker somewhere, too quiet to make out the words.

"This case reminds you of something," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

Brandon looked up. "What makes you say that?"

"The way you're working it. You've been different since we took the call." Matt gestured with his fork. "Usually you're clinical. Going through the steps. This one's getting to you."

Brandon was quiet long enough that Matt thought he might not answer. Then: "There was a case in Missouri. Ashford. Small town like this one. Woman was abducted from a payphone in the center of town. She was on the phone with her boyfriend because he was stuck home babysitting his little brother. He heard her get taken. Rushed out of the house and tried to get there in time. Saw the vehicle fleeing, but couldn't catch it."

"When was this?"

"Twenty-one years ago back in June." Brandon pushed his plate away. Most of the burger was still there. "Never solved. No body. No leads. Just gone."

Matt did the math. Twenty-one years put it at 1990. His Air Force years, before he'd joined the Bureau. Brandon would have been a kid. "You worked this as a cold case?"

"No. I just... heard about it." Brandon's fingers found the sugar packet again. "It stayed with me."

There was something else there. Matt could see it in the way Brandon's jaw tightened, the way he wouldn't quite meet Matt's eyes. Pushing didn't usually work with Gray, but he let his curiousity get the better of him.

"Were there any witnesses other than the boyfriend?" Matt asked casually. Are they definitely sure he wasn't involved."

Matt saw anger flare suddenly in Brandon's deep green eyes.

"The boyfriend had nothing to do with it. He's beyond reproach."

Matt was taken aback. Brandon's hands had clenched into fists on the table. He noticed, seemed to realize it, and deliberately relaxed them.

Matt chose his next words carefully.

"Similar circumstances don't mean the same perpetrator," Matt said carefully. "Ashford to here is what, six or seven hours?"

"Six and a half." Brandon looked toward the window again. "I know it's not the same guy. Wrong profile. And it was twenty-one years ago; the Missouri perp would be too old at this point to be our guy. Plus that case had different markers. Different approach."

"But it reminds you."

"It reminds me that some of them get away with it." Brandon's voice was flat. "That some cases stay cold. That we don't always find them."

Matt watched his partner stare at nothing. In three years, he'd rarely seen Brandon like this—invested in a way that went past professional obligation. Usually Gray approached cases like logic puzzles. Interesting problems to solve, then move on to the next one. This was different. This was personal in a way Matt didn't fully understand.

"We're going to work this one right," Matt said. "Full resources. We'll stay as long as it takes. If there's a solve here, we'll find it."

Brandon nodded but didn't respond.

Dottie brought the check. Matt paid cash and left a twenty percent tip. Outside, the temperature had dropped into the forties. Matt's breath fogged in the air. Brandon stood by the car for a moment, looking back toward the diner like he'd forgotten something.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"Fine." Brandon got in the passenger seat.

They drove back to the motel—a Quality Inn just off Route 39 on the way to Blackburn, the closest lodging to Thorndale with more than six rooms. The parking lot was nearly empty. Matt pulled into a spot near their rooms. They'd booked adjoining doubles, doors that connected in case they needed to work late or share files.

"Tomorrow we start with the library," Matt said. "Talk to her coworkers. Get a sense of who came in regularly. Who might have paid attention to her."

"And the truck owners," Brandon added. "I want to see that list from the initial investigation. Verify they actually talked to everyone."

"Agreed."

Brandon got out but didn't head toward his room. He stood in the parking lot, hands in his pockets, looking up at the sky. No moon. No stars visible through the cloud cover.

"What is it?" Matt asked.

"She was twenty-two. Had her whole life ahead of her. Working at the library because she liked being around books. Lived with her mother. Helped with the bills." Brandon's voice was quiet. "She called her mom to say she'd be late. Didn't want her to worry."

Matt didn't know what to say to that. After a moment, Brandon walked to his door, unlocked it, and went inside without another word.

Matt stood alone in the parking lot for a moment longer. The case felt heavier now than it had that morning. They usually did, but this was different. He checked his watch. Eight forty-three. Still early. He could review the file again, make notes, prepare for tomorrow's interviews.

Instead, he went to his room, kicked off his shoes, and lay on the bed with the lights off. Through the thin wall, he could hear the faint sound of Brandon moving around next door. A faucet running. The creak of bedsprings. Then silence.

Matt closed his eyes and tried to picture the Crossroads Mini-Mart as it had been six months ago, in spring. Sarah Carpenter standing by the payphone, leaving a message for her friend. A truck pulling up. Someone familiar walking toward her. That moment of recognition, then realization. Then nothing.

Somewhere in this town, someone knew what had happened after that. Someone who drove a Silverado. Someone Sarah had recognized but hadn't been afraid of.

Until it was too late.

Matt's phone buzzed. A text from Brandon: *In case I'm wrong about this being his first time, check missing persons in Indiana and the neighboring states. 2000-present. Specifically with a similar victim profile.*

Matt typed back: *Will do. Get some sleep.*

No response.

Matt set his phone on the nightstand and stared at the ceiling. Tomorrow they'd start building the case. Interviewing witnesses. Running down leads. Doing the work.

But tonight, lying in a motel room in a town he'd never heard of until yesterday, Matt wondered about the things Brandon wasn't saying. About Missouri and payphones and cases that stayed cold.

About why some cases got to you more than others.

# Chapter Two
**Thursday Morning**

Brandon Gray had been awake since four-thirty. Not unusual. Sleep came in fragments on cases like this—two hours, then awake, then another hour if he was lucky. He'd learned to work with it rather than fight it.

By six he was dressed and downstairs in the Quality Inn's breakfast area, a corner room off the lobby with industrial carpet and fluorescent lights that hummed at a frequency most people didn't notice. Brandon noticed. He'd positioned himself at a table in the back corner, away from the windows, with a clear view of the entrance and the coffee station.

The case files were spread across the table in front of him, arranged in an order that would look haphazard to anyone else. Witness statements on the left, organized by proximity to the scene. Security footage stills in the center, sequenced by timestamp. Victimology on the right—Sarah Carpenter's life in documents and photographs.

He had a cup of black coffee cooling in front of him. It was surprisingly good quality for a hotel, some regional brand.
>COMMENT: making the coffee a bit higher quality. People in the rural Midwest often take more care in their jobs. The service at a hotel like this might be strong even if the building has seen better days.

Three other people occupied the breakfast area. An older couple near the waffle maker, talking quietly about their grandson's football game. A man in his forties at a table by the window, reading the local newspaper while eating a bagel. The man wore no wedding ring but had a tan line that suggested there should be one there. Recent divorce, or possibly a man looking to cheat while on the road.

Brandon returned his attention to the files. Sarah Carpenter's face looked up at him from her library ID photo—twenty-two, dark blonde hair pulled back, blue eyes, the kind of smile that made you want to smile back. She'd started at the Blackburn Public Library three years ago, right after high school. Circulation desk, children's programs, whatever needed doing. Her supervisor called her reliable. Her coworker called her sweet. Her mother called her gone.

The phone records showed her last three calls: AAA at 8:12 PM, her mother at 8:14 PM, Jessica Holt at 8:17 PM. The third call had gone to voicemail. The transcript of the recovered message was in the file. *Hey Jess, it's me. My car died at the Crossroads and I'm waiting for a tow but it's going to be like an hour and I'm freezing out here. Any chance you could—*

The message cut off mid-sentence. Not because she'd hung up. Because something had interrupted her.

Someone.

Brandon picked up his coffee. It had gone lukewarm. He drank it anyway.

He thought about the moments before an abduction. The victim's awareness shifting from mundane annoyance to confusion to fear. That transition was usually fast—split second, not seconds. But Sarah had known her abductor. That changed the timeline. Extended it. She'd had time to realize something was wrong before it was too late to run.

The physiological response to that realization: elevated heart rate, adrenaline spike, pupils dilating, time distortion. Some victims later reported those seconds feeling like minutes. The brain processing threat assessment at accelerated speed. Fight, flight, or freeze.

Sarah had frozen. Or tried to talk her way out. The purse left behind suggested she hadn't run. The absence of blood at the scene suggested no immediate violence...meant she hadn't fought. She'd gone with him. Maybe thinking she still had a chance to de-escalate. To reason with someone she knew.

She'd been wrong.

Brandon set the coffee down and pulled out his phone. He opened the photos he'd taken yesterday at the Crossroads. The payphone. The angle from the mini-mart door. The spot where Sarah's car had been parked.

He'd stood there for ninety minutes, not moving, barely breathing, letting the scene settle in his mind the way it always did. Not intuition, exactly. Just intense focus. Most people looked at crime scenes and cataloged evidence. Brandon tried to reconstruct the event itself—imagining movements, psychology, the sequence of actions that left the traces behind.

In his mind, he could picture Sarah standing by the phone, receiver to her ear, shifting her weight from foot to foot because it had been a chilly spring evening and she was impatient. The truck pulling in, dark paint catching the security light. The driver's door opening, someone stepping out. Someone Sarah recognized.

Her body language changed. Still relaxed, but curious. A small wave, maybe. A question forming.

Then the shift. Subtle at first. Her posture straightening. The hand not holding the phone moving slightly away from her body—unconscious preparation to defend herself or create distance.

But by then it would have been already too late.

"You're up early."

Brandon looked up. Matt stood by the table, holding a paper plate with a waffle, some fruit, and three slices of bacon. He'd showered and shaved. His shirt was pressed, sleeves rolled evenly. Even at six-thirty in the morning, Matt Ellis looked like an FBI recruitment poster.

"Couldn't sleep," Brandon said.

Matt sat down across from him, surveying the spread of files. "Learn anything new?"

"Sarah was a creature of habit. Same route home every day. Same stop at the Crossroads for gas every Thursday after her shift. She was predictable."

"Which made her easy to watch."

"And easy to intercept." Brandon gathered the files into a stack, his system disrupted now that Matt was there. "If he tampered with her car, he did it while she was at the library. That's a narrow window. Her shift ended at eight. She left by eight-oh-five according to her coworker. Car was parked in the employee lot behind the building. He would've have had to do it after 7pm when early staff ended their day. He wouldn't have wanted to be seen."

"So he knew the library's layout. Knew where employees parked."

"Wouldn't be hard if he'd been watching Sarah." Brandon closed the last file. "We need to talk to her co-workers. See who paid attention to her. Who asked questions."

Matt cut into his waffle. "That's the plan. Library opens at ten. I talked to the head librarian yesterday. She said she'd make time for us."

Brandon nodded. He checked his watch. Seven forty-three. Two hours and seventeen minutes until the library opened. He could review the files again. Cross-reference the truck registrations with library patron records, see if any names overlapped. Start building a geographic profile of the suspect based on the abduction site and—

"You should eat something," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him.

"You didn't eat much at dinner last night. And you're going to need energy for interviews." Matt gestured toward the breakfast spread. "At least grab a banana or something."

Brandon stood. Matt was right—he often forgot to eat when he was working. His body didn't send the same hunger signals other people seemed to get. He'd go hours without noticing, then feel lightheaded and realize he'd skipped meals.

He walked to the breakfast bar and picked up a banana, a bagel, and a container of cream cheese. When he returned to the table, Matt had moved some of the files aside to make room.

They sat in silence for a few minutes. The older couple left, waving goodbye to the front desk clerk. The man by the window remained. He was focused on the screen of his phone, probably reading a text message. Brandon watched him peripherally. The way he hunched over the screen. The tension in his shoulders. Whatever he was reading wasn't good news.

"You mentioned Missouri last night," Matt said quietly. "Ashford."

Brandon peeled the banana. "Yeah."

"Want to talk about it?"

"Not much to talk about. Unsolved abduction. Twenty-one years old."

"Twenty-one years is a long time to remember a case you were far too young to have worked."

Brandon took a bite of banana. Chewed. Swallowed. "Some cases stick with you."

Matt waited, but Brandon didn't elaborate. After a moment, Matt returned to his waffle. He knew when to push and when to let something sit. Brandon appreciated that. It was one of the things that made him a good partner.

Brandon finished the banana and prepared his bagel. The cream cheese was strawberry. Too sweet, but the sugar would give him energy. He ate it mechanically while thinking about the library. Small town facility, probably built in the early 1900s. Carnegie library if he had to guess, based on the address and the architectural style common to that era. Limited staff. Everyone would know everyone. If someone had been paying unusual attention to Sarah, her coworkers would have noticed.

Unless the person had been careful. Unless they'd blended in so well that their attention seemed normal until it was too late.

"I'm driving this morning," Brandon said.

Matt looked up. "Yeah?"

"I want to take the route Sarah would have taken. Thorndale to the library in Blackburn then to the Crossroads. See what's between."

"Good idea."

They finished breakfast and went back to their rooms to gather their things. Brandon brushed his teeth, checked that his badge and weapon were secure, and grabbed his jacket. The gray oxford shirt from yesterday was wrinkled beyond saving. He'd brought a spare—light blue, still wrinkled but less noticeably. He tucked it in only on the right for access to his weapon.

At seven-fifteen they met at the car. Brandon took the driver's seat. Matt handed him a travel mug of coffee from the lobby.

"You didn't have to do that," Brandon said.

"I know."

Brandon pulled out of the parking lot and headed south on Route 39 toward Blackburn. The morning was overcast, the sky a uniform gray that suggested rain later. The temperature had dropped overnight. Frost edged the grass along the roadside.

The library was off the main drag in Blackburn on a little commercial street named Jackson. The drive took twelve minutes. Brandon timed it. It would've taken Sarah a little bit longer coming from her house in Thorndale. Probably closer to seventeen minutes. The library sat on Main Street, a red brick building with white columns and a copper-roofed dome that had turned green with age. A Carnegie library, as he'd suspected. Built 1912 according to the cornerstone.

He parked on the street and sat for a moment, looking at the building. Sarah had worked here. Had climbed these steps every day. Had made the coffee in the break room. Had shelved books and helped patrons and planned children's story time.

She'd worked the late shift, until closing every Thursday evening, Had driven home, stopping at the Crossroads for gas because it was on her way and the prices were a few cents cheaper than the station in town.

Until one Thursday when her car wouldn't start.

"We've got an hour and a half," Matt said. "Want to walk the route?"

Brandon nodded. They got out of the car and walked around to the back of the library. The employee parking lot was small—six spaces, all empty now. A dumpster sat in the far corner. A security light on a pole, currently off. No cameras visible.

"He could have worked on her car here without being seen," Matt said. "Especially if he did it after dark."

"She worked until eight. Light would have been fading after seven that time of year." Brandon walked to the middle of the lot, turned in a slow circle. Trees lined the back of the property, creating a natural screen from the residential street beyond. "No witnesses. No cameras. If he knew she parked here, this would be the place."

They walked back around to the front. Jackson Street was starting to wake up—a few cars, some early morning shoppers walking the cracked sidewalk, a woman opening the bakery three doors down. The smell of fresh bread drifted on the cold air.

Brandon and Matt walked south, following the route Sarah would have driven. Past the elementary school. Past the post office. At the edge of town, Jackson Street intersected Main Street which became Route 39 once you were out of town. They stopped at the town limit sign.

"Three miles to the Crossroads from here," Matt said. "Maybe four. Farm fields on both sides. A few scattered houses. No businesses."

Brandon looked south down the empty highway. "Isolated. If he'd taken her somewhere between here and there, no one would have seen."

"But he took her from the Crossroads. In front of a witness, even if that witness was inside."

"Because that's where he knew she'd be stopped. Where she'd be vulnerable." Brandon turned back toward town. "It wasn't about isolation. It was about control. He engineered the situation so she'd have to stop exactly where he wanted her."

They walked back to the library. By the time they returned, it was nine-fifty. A few cars had filled the parking lot. Lights were on inside the building.

Matt checked his watch. "Ten minutes."

Brandon sat on the front steps. The stone was cold through his pants. He watched a school bus drive past, yellow against the gray morning. A dog barked somewhere nearby. Normal sounds in a normal town where something terrible had happened.

At ten o'clock exactly, they climbed the steps and entered the library.

The interior carried the unmistakable smell of old books. Wooden floors, high ceilings, tall frosted glass windows that let in weak daylight. The circulation desk stood directly ahead. To the left, rows of stacks. To the right, a reading area with tables and chairs. A children's section in the back corner, colorful and inviting.

And on the wall near the entrance, a memorial.

Brandon stopped. He hadn't expected this, though he should have. Small towns remembered their own.

A bulletin board with a poster-sized photo of Sarah Carpenter in the center. Candid shot, not the formal ID photo he'd seen in the file. She was laughing at something off-camera, her whole face lit up. Around the photo, people had pinned notes and cards and flowers that had been pressed flat under glass. A small table beneath the board held a condolence book and a jar with fresh carnations.

Brandon approached slowly. Matt hung back, giving him space.

The notes were what you'd expect. *We miss you. You were the best. Heaven gained an angel. Thinking of you always.* Most were dated from April and May, written in the immediate aftermath of her disappearance. A few from summer. One from August.

And one from September. Last month.

Brandon leaned closer. The handwriting was different from the others—smaller, tighter, written with a ballpoint pen instead of marker. Just three words: *I'm so sorry.*

No signature.

Brandon pulled out his phone and took a photo of the note. Then he opened the condolence book. More of the same—messages of grief and remembrance, names he didn't recognize but may need to cross-reference later. Teachers. Classmates. Neighbors. The whole town had signed this book.

He flipped through the pages slowly. Most entries from April. A few scattered through the summer. And on the last page with writing, another unsigned entry: *I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.*

Different handwriting than the note on the board. Or perhaps the same person trying to disguise it.

Brandon photographed this page too.

"Can I help you gentlemen?"

He turned. A woman stood behind the circulation desk—late fifties, gray hair cut short, tall for a woman, almost six feet. She wore a cardigan over a floral dress. Her expression was polite but guarded.

Matt stepped forward, showing his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We called earlier. You must be Mrs. Holcomb."

"Patricia, please." She came around the desk, shaking their hands. Her grip was firm, her palm warm. "I have a meeting room in back where we can talk privately."

Brandon glanced back at the memorial one more time before following her.

The meeting room was small—just a table with six chairs, a whiteboard on one wall, and a window that looked out onto the employee parking lot. Patricia gestured for them to sit and closed the door.

"I've been expecting you," she said, settling into a chair across from them. "Sheriff Garrett called yesterday, said the FBI was taking a fresh look at Sarah's case. I'll help however I can, though I don't know what more I can tell you than I told the deputies last year."

Matt pulled out a notebook. "We appreciate that. Sometimes a fresh perspective can reveal new details. Can you tell us about Sarah? What kind of employee was she?"

Patricia's expression softened. "She was wonderful. Truly. Started here right out of high school, and I honestly don't know what we would have done without her. She was good with the patrons, especially the children. Patient. Kind. Always had time for people."

"What were her responsibilities?" Brandon asked.

"She worked the circulation desk mostly. Checking books in and out, helping people find materials, managing the computer stations. She also ran our children's programs—story time on Saturday mornings, the summer reading club. And she helped with shelving and processing new arrivals."

"So she interacted with a lot of people."

"Every day. We're a small library, but many of the smaller towns in the county don't have one. We stay busy. People come in for books, internet access, newspapers. Sarah knew most of the regulars by name."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Did anyone pay unusual attention to her? Ask personal questions, try to get to know her outside of work?"

Patricia hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but Brandon caught it.

"There was someone," he said.

She sighed. "Yes. Though I don't know if it means anything. We get all kinds here—lonely people looking for conversation, people who develop... attachments to staff members. It's usually harmless."

"But you noticed something about this person."

"I noticed Sarah finding excuses to be in the back when he came in. That's not like her. She was professional. She didn't avoid patrons." Patricia folded her hands on the table. "His name is Dale Kovacs. He's been coming here for years, always friendly, never caused problems. But about six months before Sarah disappeared, he started coming in more often. And he'd always end up at the circulation desk when Sarah was working."

Matt was writing. "What kind of interactions did they have?"

"Normal ones, on the surface. He'd check out books, chat about the weather, ask for recommendations. But Sarah mentioned to me once that he made her uncomfortable. She couldn't explain why. Just a feeling."

"Did she report it?" Brandon asked.

"To me, yes. I kept an eye on him after that, but I never saw him do anything inappropriate. He was just... there. Often. And he asked questions."

"What kind of questions?"

"About Sarah's schedule. Whether she'd be working on a particular day. Whether she had a boyfriend. That sort of thing." Patricia's jaw tightened. "I should have done more. Should have talked to him directly, or asked him to use a different library. But I didn't want to make accusations if nothing was actually wrong. Small town—you have to be careful about rumors."

"You couldn't have known," Matt said gently.

Brandon wasn't listening. His attention had shifted to the window behind Patricia. The employee parking lot. The trees. The absence of security cameras.

"Does Dale Kovacs drive a truck?" he asked.

Patricia blinked. "I... yes, I think so. An older model, I believe. I don't really pay attention to cars."

"When was the last time he came in?"

"I believe I saw him recently, this week. Monday...or maybe Tuesday."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a glance.

"Is he here now?" Brandon asked.

"I'm not sure. He is often here in the mornings. Let me check the system." Patricia stood and walked to the door. "I'll be right back."

When she was gone, Matt leaned closer. "Kovacs fits the profile. Knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives an older truck."

"And he's been in recently," Brandon added. "After the case was reopened."

"Returning to follow the investigation?"

"Or feeling guilty."

Patricia returned a moment later. "He was here two days ago. Checked out three books. I have his information pulled up if you need it."

They followed her to the circulation desk. She turned the computer monitor so they could see. Dale Kovacs, 46, address on County Road 275. A small photo showed a man with plain features, receding brown hair, the kind of face that would disappear in a crowd. Current checkouts: *The Complete Guide to Tracking and Stalking*, *Topographical Maps of Southern Indiana*, and *Wilderness Survival Skills*.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his stomach.

"Can we get a copy of his borrowing history?" Matt asked. "Last six months."

"I'll print it for you."

While Patricia worked the printer, Brandon scanned the library. A few patrons browsed the stacks. An middle-aged woman read a romance novel in a comfy chair. Two elderly men sat facing each other intently over a game of chess. And in the far corner, at one of the public computer terminals— 

The man from the photo. Dale Kovacs.

Brandon's hand moved to Matt's arm, a brief touch. Matt followed his gaze.

Kovacs sat with his back to them, hunched over the screen, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans. Brown hair, receding at the temples. Medium build. From this distance, he looked like anyone. Everyone. Invisible in his ordinariness.

But something was wrong. Brandon couldn't articulate it yet, but the feeling was there—the same instinct that had guided him through dozens of cases. The sense that he was looking at someone who didn't fit quite right in his own skin.

Patricia handed Matt the printout. "Anything else I can do for you?"

"Is there anyone else we should talk to? Other staff who knew Sarah?"

"Amy Chen. She worked the same shifts as Sarah sometimes. They were friendly. She's here today—comes in at eleven."

Brandon was still watching Kovacs. "Thank you, Mrs. Holcomb. We'll wait for Amy."

Patricia returned to her desk. Matt moved closer to Brandon.

"That's him?"

"Yes."

"Want to approach now?"

Brandon shook his head slightly. "Not yet. Let's see what he does."

They moved to the reading area, taking seats at a table with a clear sightline to the computer terminals. Brandon picked up a newspaper from the rack, held it open like he was reading. Matt pulled out his phone, appearing to check messages.

Kovacs worked at the computer for another ten minutes. Brandon watched his posture, his movements. The way he hunched forward, shoulders tense. The way his fingers moved across the keyboard—fast, confident. He was searching for something. Or monitoring something.

At ten-forty, Kovacs stood. He logged off the computer and walked toward the circulation desk.

Brandon lowered the newspaper slightly. Now he could see Kovacs's face.

Clean-shaven. Plain features. Nothing remarkable. The kind of face you'd forget five minutes after seeing it.

Except for the eyes. Even from across the room, Brandon could see the way Kovacs looked at Patricia—too direct, too focused. Like he was cataloging her responses, analyzing her body language.

Kovacs said something. Patricia smiled politely and scanned his library card. She handed him a slip of paper—a hold notification, probably. Kovacs thanked her and turned toward the door.

He saw Brandon and Matt.

Just a glance, nothing more. But Brandon saw the recognition flicker across his face. Not recognition of them specifically—they'd never met. Recognition of what they were. Law enforcement. Investigators.

Kovacs's expression didn't change. He walked past their table, nodded politely, and continued toward the exit.

Brandon stood and walked to the window. He watched Kovacs walk to a truck parked on the side street. A late nineties model, dark blue Silverado. A match for what the security footage had shown.

Kovacs climbed in, started the engine, and drove away.

Matt stood beside Brandon. "What do you think?"

"There's something not right about him."

"Like what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon pulled out his notebook and jotted down a note: *Dale Kovacs - watch him*.

A woman's voice behind them: "Can I help you find something?"

They turned. A young Asian woman stood there, mid-twenties, wearing a library staff badge. Amy Chen.

"We're with the FBI," Matt said, showing his badge. "We'd like to ask you some questions about Sarah Carpenter."

Amy's expression crumbled. "Oh. Okay. Yes, of course."

Patricia materialized from somewhere. "You can use the meeting room again."

They followed Amy back to the small room. She sat heavily in a chair, her hands twisting in her lap. Brandon noticed the way she wouldn't make eye contact, the way her shoulders curved inward. Grief, yes. But also guilt.

Matt took the lead. "How long did you work with Sarah?"

"Two years. Since I started here after college." Amy's voice was quiet. "We worked a lot of the same shifts. We weren't best friends or anything, but we were friendly."

"Did she mention anyone making her uncomfortable? Anyone who paid too much attention to her?"

Amy nodded. "There was a guy. Dale something. He came in a lot, and Sarah said he gave her weird vibes. She couldn't explain why. Just that something felt off about him."

"Did you ever interact with him?"

"A few times. He seemed normal to me. Polite, quiet. But Sarah had good instincts about people." Amy's eyes filled. "I should have paid more attention. Should have... I don't know. Been there more."

"This isn't your fault," Matt said.

"Everyone keeps saying that. But the last time I saw her, she asked if I wanted to get dinner after work that Thursday. And I said no because I had a date. If I'd said yes, if I'd been with her, maybe—"

"You couldn't have known," Brandon said. His voice was quiet but firm. "The person responsible is the only one at fault."

Amy wiped her eyes. "I just want someone to find her. To bring her home. Her mom—Mrs. Carpenter—she just wants to know what happened. That's all."

Brandon thought about the memorial board. The unsigned notes. The weight of unanswered questions.

"Did Sarah ever mention wanting to leave Thorndale?" he asked. "Going back to school, moving away?"

Amy looked up, surprised. "Yeah. She'd applied to Indiana State in Terre Haute for the fall semester. She wanted to study English first, then a master's in library science, maybe become a librarian at a university somewhere. She'd been saving up for it. She just needed more time."

Time she never got.

They talked for another twenty minutes. Amy provided names of other regulars, described Sarah's routine, confirmed that Dale Kovacs had been increasingly present in the months before the abduction. When they were done, Amy stood slowly.

"Do you think you'll find her?" she asked.

Matt's expression was kind but honest. "We're going to try."

After Amy left, Brandon and Matt sat in silence for a moment.

"Right now, Kovacs is our primary suspect," Matt said. "Everything points to him."

"Too much points to him." Brandon stared at the window. "It's too neat."

"Sometimes it is neat. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right answer."

"Maybe." Brandon stood and walked to the window. The parking lot was empty except for staff vehicles. Beyond the trees, he could see a sliver of the residential street. Normal houses. Normal lives.

"I want to see his property," Brandon said. "County Road 275. See if anything stands out."

"We'll need a warrant to search."

"I don't want to search. Just drive by. Look."

Matt checked his watch. "It's eleven-thirty. We should check in with the sheriff, see if they've made any progress on the truck owner list."

Brandon nodded but didn't move from the window. His mind was working through the timeline, the evidence, the psychology. Dale Kovacs fit the profile. Made Sarah uncomfortable. Drove the right truck. Had been here that day. Had the knowledge to tamper with her car. Asked questions about her. Returned to the library after the case was reopened.

But something was wrong. Some piece didn't fit.

"The memorial," Brandon said suddenly. "The unsigned notes."

"You think Kovacs wrote them?"

"Maybe. He wasn't secretive about his interest in Sarah. They're obviously from someone who feels guilty." He turned to face Matt. "Someone who knew something and didn't speak up. Or helped. Maybe that's Kovacs, maybe it isn't."

"An accomplice?"

"Or a witness who kept quiet."

They left the meeting room and walked back through the library. Brandon paused again at Sarah's memorial. The smiling photo. The messages from people who missed her. The flowers that someone kept fresh.

He took out his phone and photographed the entire board, zooming in on each note, each card, each detail.

When he stepped back, Matt was watching him.

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. Matt's expression held genuine concern. After three years working together, Matt had learned to read his moods, his silences, his withdrawal into himself when a case hit too close.

"I will be," Brandon said. "When we solve it."

They walked outside into the cold morning. The sky had darkened. Rain was coming.

Brandon stood on the library steps and looked south down Main Street, toward Route 39, toward the Crossroads three miles away. He thought about Sarah Carpenter making this drive every Thursday, her routine so predictable that someone had learned it, studied it, exploited it.

He thought about Missouri. About a payphone and a boyfriend who couldn't get there in time. About an ten-year-old boy who didn't understand why his big brother wouldn't talk about that night.

He thought about all the people who disappeared and never came home.

"Let's go," he said. "I want to drive the route to the Crossroads then see where Kovacs lives."

They got in the car. Brandon drove, his hands steady on the wheel, his mind already mapping the route, calculating distances, imagining scenarios.

Somewhere in this small town, Sarah Carpenter's body was waiting to be found.

And somewhere in this small town, Dale Kovacs was waiting too.

Waiting to see if they'd figure it out in time.

# Chapter Three
**Thursday Late Morning**

Matt drove this time. Brandon sat in the passenger seat with his phone out, studying the satellite view of Dale Kovacs's property on Google Maps. County Road 275 ran east-west about four miles south of Thorndale, cutting through farmland and scattered residential plots. Kovacs's address put him two miles from the nearest neighbor.

"Twelve acres," Brandon said, zooming in on the image. "House, barn, what looks like a garage or workshop. Heavily wooded on the north side."

Matt kept his eyes on the road. They'd left the library twenty minutes ago. The sky had darkened further, and the first drops of rain hit the windshield. "We're just driving by. Observing from the road. No stop, no approach."

"I know."

"I mean it, Gray. We don't have probable cause for a search warrant. We can't even knock on his door without risking complications later."

Brandon looked up from his phone. "Understood."

Matt relaxed slightly. The rain came harder. He turned on the wipers. The rhythmic sweep was the only sound for a moment.

"What's our next move after this?" Matt asked. "Assuming we don't see anything obvious."

"We need surveillance footage from businesses on Route 39 between here and the Crossroads. Gas stations, farm supply stores, anything with cameras pointing at the road. If Kovacs drove that route the night Sarah disappeared, maybe someone caught his truck."

"That's eighteen months ago. Most places don't keep footage that long."

"Some do. Worth checking." Brandon scrolled through something on his phone. "And we need to re-interview Travis Walton. The witness from the Crossroads. His statement was thin."

Matt had read Walton's statement three times. Thirty-one years old, worked construction, had stopped for cigarettes. Saw Sarah's purse by the payphone, called 911. Told deputies he didn't see or hear anything. "You think he's hiding something?"

"I think he saw more than he told them. Maybe not much more, but something. Sometimes you just need to ask the right questions."

The GPS announced their turn. Matt slowed and turned onto County Road 275. The pavement was cracked and patched, weeds growing through the edges. Fields stretched out on both sides—corn stubble from the fall harvest, waiting for winter.

"Half a mile ahead," Brandon said.

Matt eased off the gas, dropping to thirty miles per hour. His pulse kicked up slightly. This was the part of the job that required control—driving past a suspect's property knowing you couldn't stop, couldn't search, couldn't do anything but look.

The first structure that appeared was a mailbox. Faded red with the numbers 6847 in peeling white paint. Matt noted it without slowing further.

"That's it," Brandon said quietly.

The property sat back from the road about a hundred feet. The driveway was gravel, rutted from use. The house itself was a small ranch-style structure, probably built in the sixties or seventies. White siding gone gray with age and weather. Black shutters. A concrete front porch with no furniture, no welcome mat, nothing that suggested anyone cared about the property's appearance.

Behind the house, partially visible through the rain, was the barn. Weathered red wood, the paint mostly gone. The roof sagged slightly in the middle. One of the large doors hung at an angle, the bottom hinge broken or missing.

Matt kept driving at a steady pace, not too slow, not too fast. Just a car passing by on a rural road.

But something felt wrong.

He couldn't articulate it—no specific detail he could point to. Just a weight in his chest, a tightness that said *pay attention*. The property had the look of a place where bad things happened and nobody noticed.

Brandon had turned in his seat, looking back.

Matt drove another hundred yards, then pulled onto the shoulder and stopped.

"What are you doing?" Brandon asked.

Matt stared at the rearview mirror. Rain obscured the property now, but he could still picture it. The sagging barn. The lifeless house. The woods pressing in from the north side.

"We should knock and talk," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him. "I thought we weren't stopping."

"We're not searching. We're just following up on our conversation at the library. Seeing if Kovacs remembered anything else." Matt put the car in reverse, backing carefully along the shoulder. "It's a legitimate investigative technique."

"Since when are you the one pushing boundaries?"

"Since I got a bad feeling about that barn." Matt turned into Kovacs's driveway. The gravel crunched under the tires. "You're not the only one with instincts."

Brandon said nothing, but Matt caught the slight upturn at the corner of his partner's mouth.

The driveway curved slightly, bringing them closer to the house. Matt parked about thirty feet from the front porch, leaving room to turn around quickly if needed. He killed the engine. The rain drummed on the roof.

"His truck's not here," Brandon observed.

Matt had already noticed. No vehicles visible. No lights on in the house. No movement in the windows.

They got out. The rain soaked through Matt's shirt immediately. He pulled his jacket tighter and walked toward the front porch. Brandon followed a step behind. Moving slower, less bothered by the falling rain.

The porch was concrete, cracked in several places. Dead leaves had collected in the corners. A window air conditioning unit sat dark in one window, plastic sheeting taped around it for winter. The front door was white metal with a small window at eye level, covered from the inside with a curtain.

Matt knocked. Three solid raps. "Mr. Kovacs? FBI. We'd like to talk to you."

No answer. No sound from inside.

He knocked again. Waited.

Nothing.

"Not home," Matt said, stating the obvious.

Brandon had moved to the edge of the porch, looking toward the barn. The rain made it hard to see clearly, but the structure loomed dark against the gray sky.

"I'm going to look around," Brandon said.

Matt should have stopped him. Should have said they'd done their due diligence, knocked on the door, no one home, time to leave. But that feeling in his chest hadn't gone away. If anything, it had gotten stronger.

"Stay within plain view," Matt said. "Don't go inside anything."

Brandon stepped off the porch and walked toward the barn.

Matt followed, his shoes squelching in the muddy ground. The rain had turned the yard into soft earth that stuck to his soles. He could feel water running down his collar.

The barn sat about fifty yards behind the house. As they got closer, Matt could see it was in worse shape than it had looked from the road. The wood was rotted in places. Several boards had fallen away, leaving gaps in the walls. The door that hung crooked swayed slightly in the wind.

Brandon stopped about ten feet from the entrance. He stood very still, rain streaming down his face, staring at the barn.

"Gray?" Matt said quietly.

Brandon didn't answer. His expression had gone distant, unfocused. Matt recognized that look—the same one Brandon got at crime scenes, when he was processing something Matt couldn't see.

After a long moment, Brandon walked to the barn entrance. He grabbed the edge of the crooked door and pulled it open wider. It caught on its broken hinge and groaned audibly despite the rain.

"Brandon," Matt said, louder now. "We can't go in without—"

But Brandon had already stepped inside.

Matt swore under his breath and followed.

The interior was dark and smelled of rot and old hay. Rain came through gaps in the roof, creating pools on the dirt floor. Matt's eyes adjusted slowly. He could make out wooden support beams, a hayloft above, farming equipment that looked like it hadn't been used in decades. A rusted plow. Some kind of harvester with a flat tire.

Brandon stood in the center of the space, turning slowly. His breathing had changed—slower, deeper. His hands hung at his sides.

"Brandon," Matt said again. Quieter this time, almost a whisper, because something about the space demanded quiet.

"Something happened here." Brandon's voice barely audible over the rain.

Matt felt the hair on his arms stand up. The barn was just a barn. Old, rotting, abandoned. There was nothing obviously wrong with it.

But he felt it too. That same wrongness he'd felt driving past the property. Concentrated here, in this space.

Brandon walked to the back corner, where shadows were deepest. He crouched down, his hand hovering over the dirt floor without quite touching it.

"What do you see?" Matt asked.

Brandon didn't answer. He stayed crouched for what felt like a full minute, motionless except for his eyes tracking something across the floor. Then he stood and moved to one of the support beams. His fingers traced the wood about four feet up from the ground.

"We need to come back," Brandon said. "With a warrant and a forensics team."

"Based on what?"

Brandon turned to face him. In the dim light, his expression was hard to read. "She was here, Matt. Sarah was here."

"How do you—"

"She was here." Brandon's voice was flat, certain. "And this is where she died."

Matt wanted to ask how Brandon knew. Wanted concrete evidence, something he could put in a report. But Brandon was already walking toward the entrance, moving quickly now, like he needed to get out.

Matt followed him back into the rain. Brandon walked several yards away from the barn and stopped, breathing hard. Not from exertion. From something else.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

Brandon nodded, but didn't speak.

Matt looked back at the barn. Just an old structure on a rural property. Nothing obviously incriminating. Nothing a judge would accept as probable cause.

But Brandon was right. Matt felt it in his gut. Something terrible had happened in that barn.

"Let's go," Matt said. "We need to talk to the sheriff's office. Figure out how to get a legal search going."

They walked back to the car, both soaked through. Matt started the engine and turned the heat on high. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, his jaw tight.

Matt backed out of the driveway and headed toward Rockville, the county seat. Twenty-five minutes away. Where they'd meet with Chief Deputy whoever-he-was and try to explain why they needed a warrant to search a barn based on a feeling.

Neither of them spoke during the drive. The rain continued. The wipers beat their rhythm.

Matt kept thinking about the way Brandon had moved through that barn. The certainty in his voice when he said Sarah had died there.

Three years working with Brandon Gray, and Matt still didn't understand how his partner knew the things he knew.

But he'd learned to trust it.

And right now, every instinct Matt had—the normal ones, the ones based on observation and experience and gut feeling—was telling him Brandon was right.

Sarah Carpenter had been in that barn.

And their next step was to prove it.

---

The Parke County Sheriff's Office sat on the west side of Rockville's courthouse square, a two-story brick building that looked like it had been built in the seventies and never updated. Matt pulled into the visitor parking lot at eleven-fifteen. The rain had lessened to a drizzle.

"Let me do most of the talking," Matt said as they got out of the car. "At least at first."

Brandon nodded. He'd been quiet the entire drive, staring out the window at the passing farmland. His shirt was still damp from the barn, and he'd turned the heat vent directly on himself for the last ten minutes of the drive.

Inside, the building smelled like old coffee and floor wax. A reception desk sat behind bulletproof glass. A woman in her fifties with reading glasses and a sheriff's office polo looked up when they entered.

Matt showed his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We're here to see Chief Deputy—" He paused, realizing he didn't have a name.

"Dunham," the woman said. "Tom Dunham. You're the ones working the Carpenter case?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She picked up a phone, pressed a button. "Tom, the FBI agents are here." A pause. "Okay." She hung up and pointed to a door on their right. "Through there. Second office on the left."

The hallway was narrow, lined with photos of past sheriffs and deputies. Matt counted eight different sheriffs going back to 1952. At the end of the hall, a break room door stood open. Inside, someone was heating something in a microwave that smelled like burned popcorn.
>COMMENT: I like the tactile detail of the microwave's smell but burnt popcorn is a bit cliche for it.

The second office on the left had a nameplate: Chief Deputy Tom Dunham. The door was open. Matt knocked on the frame anyway.

"Come in."

The office was small but organized. A metal desk with a computer monitor, stacks of files arranged by some system that probably made sense to their owner, and a bookshelf holding law enforcement manuals and what looked like case binders. The walls held certificates and commendations, most from the Joliet Police Department in Illinois.
>COMMENT: I don't like "some system that probably made sense to their owner." Dunham is a seasoned, competent investigator but not a particularly intuitive one. I think he'd have them organized in a pretty standard way like chronologically or alphabetically.

Chief Deputy Tom Dunham stood and came around the desk. Late forties, maybe fifty. Average height, stocky build that suggested he'd been more muscular in his younger years. Thinning brown hair cut short. He wore khakis and a button-down shirt with a tie loosened at the collar. His handshake was firm but perfunctory.
>COMMENT: Maybe replace "stocky build that suggested he'd been more muscular in his younger years" with "slightly overweight in a way that suggested an ex-athlete gone to seed."

"Tom Dunham," he said. "Sheriff Garrett said you'd be stopping by."

"Matt Ellis." Matt gestured to Brandon. "This is my partner, Brandon Gray."

Dunham shook Brandon's hand, then gestured to two chairs across from his desk. "Have a seat. Coffee?"

"We're good, thanks," Matt said.

They sat. Dunham returned to his chair and leaned back slightly, his expression neutral but guarded. Not hostile, exactly. Just the look of someone who'd seen federal agents come and go before and wasn't particularly optimistic about the outcome.

"Sheriff said the Bureau's taking a fresh look at Sarah Carpenter," Dunham said. "Eighteen months cold. That's a long time."

"Sometimes fresh eyes help," Matt said. "We appreciate you reaching out to us."

"That was the sheriff's call. I just work here." Dunham's tone was flat, matter-of-fact. "But yeah, I was the one who worked the case when she first disappeared. Me and Deputy Kowalski—you met him yesterday at the Crossroads."

"We did. He was helpful."

"He's a good kid. Still green, but he follows procedure." Dunham pulled a file from one of the stacks on his desk. Thick manila folder, Sarah Carpenter's name written on the tab. "I've got everything we compiled. Witness statements, security footage, the truck canvas, phone records. You probably already have copies, but if you need originals, they're here."

Matt leaned forward slightly. "We've reviewed the files. I wanted to ask about the truck canvas. Seventeen Chevy Silverados, dark blue or green, late nineties models. You talked to all the owners?"

"Every single one. Most of them personally, a few by phone if they were out of state." Dunham opened the file, flipped through pages. "Checked alibis, looked at the vehicles when we could. Nothing stood out. A couple guys were squirrelly about letting us look in their truck beds, but that turned out to be because one had an open container violation and the other was behind on registration."

"What about people who had access to those trucks but weren't the registered owners?" Brandon asked. It was the first time he'd spoken since they'd arrived.

Dunham looked at him. "Like who?"

"Family members. Employees. Friends who borrowed vehicles."

"We asked. Nobody had anything that seemed relevant." Dunham closed the file. "Look, I know what you're thinking. Small county sheriff's office, limited resources, maybe we missed something. And maybe we did. But we worked this case hard for three months. Every lead, every tip, every person who even looked at Sarah sideways. It all went nowhere."

Matt kept his tone even. "We're not here to second-guess your work, Chief Deputy. We're just trying to find new angles."

"Call me Tom." Dunham's expression softened slightly, though the guardedness remained. "And I get it. Really. This case—" He paused, looking at the file on his desk. "Sarah Carpenter was a good kid. Worked at the library, helped her mom pay bills, planning to go to college. She didn't deserve what happened to her. Her mother doesn't deserve to not know."

"You've stayed in touch with Mrs. Carpenter?" Brandon asked.

"Someone from the office checks in about once a month. Usually me. Let her know we haven't forgotten." Dunham's jaw tightened. "But eighteen months with no leads, no body, no activity on her cards or phone—it's hard to tell a mother we're still working it when we don't have anything to work."

Matt glanced at Brandon, then back to Dunham. "We may have a lead. A person of interest we'd like to look into further."

Dunham sat up straighter. "Who?"

"Dale Kovacs. Forty-six, lives on County Road 275. He was a regular at the library where Sarah worked. Made her uncomfortable. Drives a dark blue Silverado, late nineties model. And he was at the library the day she disappeared."

Dunham's expression didn't change, but Matt saw the recognition in his eyes. "Kovacs was on our list. We talked to him back in April of last year. He said he was at the library that afternoon, left around seven, went home. Lived alone, no alibi, but no direct evidence linking him to the abduction. Just happened to drive the same truck."

"Did you search his property?" Brandon asked.

"Didn't have cause. He was cooperative, answered questions, let us look in his truck. Nothing suspicious. No blood, no signs of a struggle, no personal items that didn't belong to him."

"What about his barn?" Brandon's voice was quiet, controlled.

Dunham frowned. "What about it?"

"Did you search it?"

"Drove by the property, saw the barn from the road. But there are a lot of old barns out here. Like I said, we didn't have probable cause for a search warrant. Kovacs being creepy and driving the right truck isn't enough for a judge."

Matt chose his words carefully. "We drove by his property this morning. We got a bad feeling about that barn."

Dunham looked at Matt, then at Brandon. "A bad feeling."

"Yes."

"You want me to get you a warrant based on a bad feeling?"

"We want to find Sarah Carpenter," Brandon said. His tone was level, but there was an edge underneath. "And I think she was in that barn."

Dunham leaned back in his chair. "You *think*. Based on what evidence?"

"Kovacs fits the profile," Matt said. "He knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives the right vehicle, was present the day of the abduction. His recent library checkouts include books on wilderness survival, topographical maps, and forensic investigation techniques—"

"That's still circumstantial," Dunham interrupted. "I'm not saying it's not worth looking at. I'm saying no judge in this county is going to sign a warrant based on circumstantial evidence and a gut feeling."

"Even if that gut feeling is right?" Brandon asked.

"Even then. Because if we search without proper cause and find something, a defense attorney will get it thrown out. And if we search and don't find anything, we've violated his Fourth Amendment rights and opened the county up to a lawsuit." Dunham's voice was firm but not unkind. "I've been doing this job for twenty-six years. Twelve of those in Joliet, Illinois, where we actually had resources and case law on our side. I know how to work a case. And I know the difference between wanting to solve something and having the legal grounds to act on it."

Matt felt the frustration building but kept it off his face. "So what do you suggest?"

"Keep building the case. Interview more people. Cross-reference Kovacs's movements with Sarah's routine. Find a witness who saw his truck near the Crossroads that night. Get phone records, financial records, anything that puts him at the scene or establishes a pattern of stalking behavior." Dunham tapped the desk. "Get me something concrete, and I'll take it to Judge Morrison myself. But I'm not asking for a warrant based on vibes."

Brandon stood abruptly. "Excuse me." He walked out of the office.

Matt stayed seated, watching Dunham's reaction.

"Your partner always like that?" Dunham asked.

"Sometimes. This case is getting to him."

"It got to me too. Still does." Dunham's expression softened again. "Look, Agent Ellis—Matt—I want to help. I really do. If Kovacs is our guy, I want him in a cell. But I also want the conviction to stick. And that means doing everything by the book."

"I understand." Matt stood. "Can we get access to the original case files, including your personal notes? Sometimes there are observations that don't make it into the official reports."

"Sure. I'll have them ready for you tomorrow morning. Where are you staying?"

"Quality Inn off Route 39."

"I'll call when they're ready." Dunham walked Matt to the door. "For what it's worth, I hope your gut is right. I hope Sarah's in that barn and we can bring her home. But we have to do this right."

"Agreed."

Matt found Brandon outside, standing by the car in the drizzle. He wasn't getting in, just standing there with his hands in his pockets, staring at nothing.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"He's not wrong." Brandon's voice was flat. "We need more than what we have."

"So we get it. We re-interview Walton. We track down surveillance footage. We build the case until it's airtight."

Brandon turned to look at him. "And if Kovacs destroys evidence while we're building the case? If he moves the body?"

"If he was going to do that, he would have done it already. It's been eighteen months."

"Or maybe he's been waiting to see if anyone would come looking. And now we have." Brandon's jaw was tight. "We were at his property this morning. If he has cameras, he knows. If a neighbor saw us, word will get back to him. Small town—everyone talks."

Matt hadn't thought of that. "Then we move fast. But we move legally."

Brandon didn't respond. He got in the passenger seat and closed the door.

Matt stood in the drizzle for a moment longer, thinking about the barn. About Brandon's certainty. About Dunham's very reasonable insistence on proper procedure.

About the fact that they were probably right—both of them.

He got in the car and started the engine.

"Where to?" Brandon asked.

Matt checked his watch. Eleven-forty. "Let's get lunch. Then we track down Travis Walton and see what he remembers that he didn't tell the deputies the first time."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had stopped, leaving everything wet and gray. Matt's mind was already working through the next steps. Witness interviews. Records requests. Building the legal framework that would let them do what they both knew needed to be done.

Search that barn.

Find Sarah Carpenter.

And prove that Brandon's instincts—whatever they were, however they worked—had been right all along.

# Chapter Four
**Thursday Afternoon**

Brandon finished the last bite of his gas station sandwich as Matt pulled into the construction site. Turkey and swiss on wheat bread, it provided sustenance and not much else. He'd barely noticed eating it. His mind was still in that barn, replaying the impressions that had settled over him like a weight.

The construction site sat on the north edge of Thorndale where Main Street became farmland. A sign near the entrance read "Hoosier Heritage Homes - Custom Building Since 1987." Beyond it, a concrete foundation had been poured for what would eventually be someone's house. Probably their dream house, given the size of the footprint. But today, with the rain still misting down and the sky the color of wet concrete, the site looked abandoned.

A white pickup truck was parked near a job trailer—the kind contractors used as mobile offices. The truck had "Walton Construction" painted on the door in fading letters. Matt had called ahead. Travis Walton was expecting them.

"You want me to take the lead on this one?" Matt asked as he put the car in park.

Brandon crumpled the sandwich wrapper. "I've got it."

They got out. The rain had lessened to a fine mist that hung in the air rather than falling. Brandon's shirt was still damp from the barn, and the cold settled into his bones as they walked toward the trailer.

The door opened before they reached it. A man in his early thirties stepped out, wearing work boots, jeans, and a Carhartt jacket over a flannel shirt. Dark hair, stubble that suggested he'd been too busy to shave that morning. He looked tired. Not just today-tired, but the kind of tired that came from carrying something heavy for a long time.

"Travis Walton?" Matt asked, showing his badge.

"Yeah." Walton shook both their hands. His grip was firm, calloused. "FBI, right? You boys move fast, you only called me an hour ago."

"We appreciate you making time," Matt said.

"Not like we're getting anything done today." Walton gestured at the gray sky. "Can't pour concrete in this weather. Can't frame either—lumber's too wet. Crew's at lunch. Figured I'd catch up on paperwork, but honestly I was just staring at invoices."

"This won't take long," Brandon said. "We just have some follow-up questions about the night Sarah Carpenter disappeared."

Walton's expression shifted—something between resignation and discomfort. "I already told the deputies everything I saw. Which wasn't much."

"I understand. Sometimes talking through it again helps clarify details." Brandon kept his voice even, neutral. Not pushy. Just patient. "Can we sit inside?"

Walton nodded and led them into the trailer. The interior was exactly what Brandon expected—cluttered but well organized. A desk covered with blueprints and invoices, a filing cabinet, a small coffee maker on a card table, folding chairs. The space heater in the corner worked overtime, making the air stuffy and warm. It smelled like diesel fuel and wood shavings.

Walton gestured to two folding chairs and took the desk chair for himself. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, then seemed to think better of it and set them on the desk.

"You still smoke?" Brandon asked.

"Trying to quit. Been saying that for three years." Walton picked up a pen, turned it over in his fingers. Nervous energy. "That's why I was at the Crossroads that night. Ran out of cigarettes, wanted to pick up a pack that night so I could get an early start the next morning."

Brandon pulled out his notebook and a pen. "Walk me through that night. What time did you get off work?"

"Round five to five-fifteen. We'd been working a job in Brazil—that's about forty minutes southwest of here. Framing a pole barn. We wrapped up, I drove back toward Thorndale."

"Did you come straight home?"

"No. Stopped at the Rural King in Blackburn first. Needed some supplies for the next day."

Brandon made notes, letting Walton establish his own timeline. "What time were you at the Rural King?"

"It's between Brazil and Thorndale, so I probably got there around five-forty. I didn't dilly-dally—grabbed what I needed, talked to Jim for a few, then paid and left."

"Jim?"

"Jim Haskell, he's the general manager there. We talked about the last Colts game for a few minutes. That's it."

Brandon nodded, writing. "Then what?"

"Drove home. Got there around six-fifteen or twenty after. Ate some leftover pizza and watched TV. I smoked my last cigarette around eight. I wanted to get to the job site in Brazil early next day, so I didn't want to stop in the morning. The gas station in Thorndale closes at seven, so I drove down to the Crossroads. It's open till eleven."

"What route did you take to the Crossroads?"

"Main Street to Route 39, then south. Same way everybody goes."

"Did you see any other vehicles on the way?"

Walton frowned, thinking. "A few. Not many—it was a Thursday night, most people were home. There was a sedan going north as I headed south. Maybe a Honda or Toyota, something like that. And a farm truck pulled out of a driveway ahead of me, but he turned off onto County Road 400."

"What about when you got to the Crossroads?"

"Sarah's car was in the lot when I pulled in. I recognized it—she drove that little red Honda Civic, had a library bumper sticker on the back. I didn't think much of it at the time. People stop there for gas all the time."

"Where did you park?"

"By the front door. The pumps were empty, so I had my choice of spots." Walton set down the pen and picked up the cigarette pack, turning it over in his hands without opening it. "I went inside. Marv was in the cooler, but he came up front when he heard me come in. I grabbed three packs of Marlboros, paid, and left. Maybe two minutes total."

"Did you notice Sarah while you were inside?"

"No. The payphone's around the side of the building. You can't see it from inside unless you're at the window, and I wasn't paying attention to windows. I was tired. Just wanted to get my cigarettes and go home."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "When you came out, what did you see?"

"Her purse was on the ground by the payphone. The phone was off the hook, hanging down. Her car was still there, but she wasn't." Walton's jaw tightened. "I called 911 right away. Stayed on the line until Deputy Kowalski showed up."

"Did you hear anything while you were inside? A scream, a car door, an engine?"

"No. Marv had the radio on. And I wasn't listening for anything. Why would I be?"

Brandon nodded, making another note. "Let me back up. When you pulled into the lot, was there any other vehicle there besides Sarah's car?"

Walton started to shake his head, then stopped. "Wait. Yeah. There was a truck parked on the far side of the building. Away from the pumps. I didn't think about it until now."

Brandon's pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral. "What kind of truck?"

"Chevy. Older model. Dark color-coulda been black, blue, or green, there's no lights on that side of the building." Walton's eyes went distant, like he was replaying the memory. "I only noticed it because it seemed like a weird place to park. The pumps were empty, the lot was empty. Why park way over there unless you didn't want to be visible from the road?"

"Did you see anyone in or near the truck?"

"No. But I wasn't looking. I assumed whoever owned it was inside the store."

Matt had his notebook out now, writing quickly. Brandon maintained eye contact with Walton. "When you came back out after buying cigarettes, was the truck still there?"

Walton closed his eyes, concentrating. "No. It was gone. I remember that now. When I saw Sarah's purse and went to call 911, I looked around to see if anyone else was there who could help. The lot was empty except for her car and mine."

"So the truck left while you were inside."

"Must have. Like I said, I was only in there two minutes. Maybe less."

Brandon made another note, his mind already working through the timeline. Sarah on the phone. Travis inside buying cigarettes. The truck pulling out with Sarah inside it. All in the space of ninety seconds, maybe two minutes.

"Did you notice anything else about the truck? Damage, bumper stickers, anything in the bed?"

Walton was quiet for a moment. Brandon watched his face—the way his eyes moved, the slight tension in his jaw. He was trying to remember, not fabricate. That was important. Witnesses who were making things up looked different. They looked up and to the left, accessing the creative parts of their brain. Walton was looking straight ahead, accessing memory.

"There was something on the back window," Walton said slowly. "One of those decals. I couldn't tell you what it was, but there was something there. Caught the light wrong, made it stand out."

"What kind of decal? Sports team? Business logo?"

"I don't know. I barely registered it. Just... something white or light-colored against the dark glass."

Brandon filed that away. "And you didn't see which direction it went when it left?"

"No. Like I said, I was inside."

"Is there anything else you remember about that night? Anything that seemed off or unusual?"

Walton shook his head slowly. "Just... I keep thinking if I'd come out of the store thirty seconds earlier at the Crossroads, maybe I could have stopped it. Maybe Sarah would still be—" His voice caught.

"This isn't your fault," Matt said. "You couldn't have known."

"Yeah, well, doesn't make it easier to sleep." Walton picked up the cigarettes again, this time pulling one out and sticking it between his lips unlit. "Is there anything else? I've got to call the crew, let them know we're done for the day."

Brandon closed his notebook. "Thank you, Mr. Walton. I appreciate you taking the time. This has been helpful."

"I have?" Walton looked genuinely surprised. "I didn't think I knew anything useful."

"Sometimes the details that don't seem important are the ones that matter." Brandon stood, and Matt followed his lead. "If you remember anything else, here's my card."

Walton took the card, studied it. "You really think you're going to find her?"

Brandon chose his words carefully. "We're going to find out what happened to her."

It wasn't quite the same thing, but it was honest.

As Brandon got up to leave, Travis spoke up again slowly.

"You know, that wasn't the only time I saw a dark colored Chevy that day. There was one at the Rural King blocking my way when I went to leave. A Silverado, dark blue. Guy was loading boxes into the back."

"Can you describe the man?"

"Average height, average build. He had a baseball cap on, kept his head down. I had to wait for him to move so I could get my truck out—he was blocking the drive." Walton looked between Brandon and Matt. "I'm not sure it was the same truck from the Crossroads, but it coulda been."

"I mighta seen the guy two hours before he took Sarah," Travis said wistfully.

"Did you get a look at his face?"

"Not really. Like I said, he had his head down. I was more focused on getting around him than looking at him." Walton ran a hand through his hair. "I should have paid more attention. Should have—"

"You had no way of knowing," Matt said quietly. "Can you remember what he was loading?"

"Boxes. Three or four of them, I think. Not huge, but he was handling them carefully. Like they were breakable or expensive."

"Were they marked? Any logos or writing you could see?"

Walton closed his eyes again, concentrating. "I don't... maybe? There might have been something printed on them, but I was too far away to read it."

"What time was this?"

"Right before I left. So around six, maybe a few minutes before."

Brandon exchanged a glance with Matt. A dark blue Silverado at the Rural King around six. At the Crossroads by eight. Two hours between.

They left Walton in his trailer and walked back to the car. The rain had stopped completely now, leaving the air cold and damp. Brandon's shoes squelched in the mud.

"Rural King at six," Matt said once they were in the car. "That gives us a place to check for surveillance footage."

"And it puts someone in a dark blue Silverado in Blackburn two hours before the abduction." Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the map. "The library's in Blackburn. So is the Rural King. If he tampered with Sarah's car while she was working, he would have had time to do it between six and seven-thirty, then drive down to the Crossroads and wait."

"What do you think he was loading at the Rural King?"

Brandon stared out at the construction site, his mind working through possibilities. "Hunting equipment, maybe. Could be trail cameras—would fit with the books Kovacs has been checking out. Wilderness survival, topographical maps. Someone planning surveillance would need equipment like that."

"That's a pretty specific conclusion from 'boxes.'"

"It's a hypothesis," Brandon said. "But it's testable. We go to the Rural King, check their transaction records, see what he bought."

Matt started the engine. "It's one-thirty. If they close at six, we've got time. But Brandon—even if we confirm someone bought trail cameras, that's still not probable cause for a warrant. We don't even know for sure it was Kovacs."

"I know. But it's another piece. And pieces add up." Brandon turned to look at his partner. "If we can identify the buyer, if we can connect him to Kovacs, if we can find out where those cameras were placed—"

"That's a lot of ifs."

"That's what investigation is."

Matt pulled out of the construction site and headed toward Blackburn. The drive would take about fifteen minutes. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about timelines and opportunities.

"You think Kovacs is working alone?" Matt asked.

"I think—" Brandon paused, choosing his words. "I think there's something about this case that doesn't add up. If Kovacs did this, why make himself so visible? Why keep checking out books that make him look guilty? Why return to the library after the case is reopened?"

"Because he's arrogant. Because he thinks he's smarter than us."

"Maybe." Brandon wasn't convinced. "Or because he's trying to solve it too."

Matt was quiet for a moment. "You think he knows who took Sarah but isn't saying?"

"I think he knows something. And whatever it is, it's eating at him." Brandon thought about the unsigned notes at the library memorial. *I'm so sorry. I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.* "Guilt is a powerful motivator. Makes people do strange things."

They drove into Blackburn, passing through downtown—a main street lined with older buildings, a few shops, a diner, the library with its Carnegie architecture and copper dome. The Rural King sat on the east edge of town, a sprawling building that sold everything from livestock feed to hardware to hunting gear and outdoor clothing.

They pulled into the parking lot. A few trucks scattered around, mostly older models with rust and dents. Working vehicles, not show pieces. Brandon scanned them automatically, looking for dark blue or green Silverados. Not expecting to find any.

Inside, the store smelled like feed and fertilizer and gun oil. A mix of rural Indiana commerce. The front area held registers and an office. To the left, hardware and building supplies. To the right, hunting and fishing gear. Straight back, livestock feed and farming equipment.

A man in his sixties stood behind the counter, wearing overalls and a John Deere cap. He looked up when they entered, his expression friendly but curious. Probably didn't get FBI agents in here often.

Matt took the lead this time. "Afternoon. We're Special Agents Ellis and Gray with the FBI. We'd like to talk to the manager about a purchase from April of last year."

The man's eyebrows went up. "April of last year? That's a long time ago."

"We understand. But we're hoping your system keeps transaction history that long."

"Let me get Jim. He's the general manager." The man disappeared into the back office and returned a moment later with a younger man—early forties, weathered face, the look of someone who'd worked retail long enough to be skeptical of everyone.

"Jim Haskell," he said, shaking their hands. "Hugh said you're hear about a transaction 18 months ago. Is this about Sarah Carpenter?"

"Yes sir," Matt said. "We understand you knew her?"

"I grew up in Thorndale with her mom. She used to come in here for gardening supplies. My kids knew Sarah, through the library. She ran most of the children's programs there. She was good with kids." Haskell's expression turned sad. "Terrible thing. You guys have a lead?"

"We're following up on several possibilities. One of them involves a customer who may have been here on April sixteenth, between five and six PM. We were hoping you could check your transaction history for the purchase."

Haskell thought for a moment. "I can probably find the transaction. You know, corporate upgraded the surveillance system to digital two years ago. All footage is stored to a hard drive now. Nothing gets overwritten. Might have to delete at some point if the hard drive gets full, but that hasn't happened yet."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a meaningful look. Matt spoke first.

"Being able to see that footage would be a huge help."

"I understand." Jim said slowly. "But I think I'll have to check with corporate legal first. They're probably going to insist on a warrant or subpeona before they'll let me hand it over."

Brandon had expected this. "We can get that. But would you be willing to look at the footage with us here? We're trying to confirm whether a specific person was here that day."

Haskell considered this. Technically, looking at his own footage with law enforcement present wasn't handing it over. He could still say no, but Brandon could see him working through it.

"Who are you looking for?" Haskell asked.

"Dale Kovacs. Drives a dark blue Silverado, mid-forties, brown hair."

Haskell's expression shifted. Recognition, but not surprise. "Yeah, I know Dale. He comes in here maybe once a month. Usually for hunting gear or tools."

"Was he here on April sixteenth?"

"I couldn't tell you without checking. That was eighteen months ago." Haskell glanced at the office, then back to them. "All right. Come on back. But I'm not giving you copies without a warrant. We can just look."

"That's all we're asking," Matt said.

They followed Haskell into the back office. The space was cramped—desk, filing cabinets, a computer setup that looked like it had been cobbled together from parts over several years. Haskell sat at the computer and pulled up the surveillance software.

"April sixteenth, 2010?" Haskell confirmed, typing.

"Yes sir," Brandon said. "Between five and six-thirty PM if possible."

The screen showed a grid of six camera angles. Front entrance, parking lot, lumber yard, hunting section, registers, and loading dock. Haskell clicked on the parking lot view and started scrubbing through the footage at 4x speed.

Brandon watched the screen. Cars coming and going, customers in and out. The afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lot. He checked the timestamp. 5:32 PM. Then 5:41 PM. Then 5:49 PM.

"There," Matt said, pointing.

A dark blue Silverado pulled into the lot and parked near the lumber yard entrance. The driver got out—average height, average build, baseball cap pulled low. He walked toward the store entrance. Thirty seconds later, he entered the store pushing a shopping cart.

Haskell switched camera views to the hunting section. The man walked directly to the trail camera display, selected four boxes, and put them in the cart. Then he moved to the register.

"Can you get a clear shot of his face?" Brandon asked.

Haskell switched to the register camera. The man kept his head down while he paid, but when he pulled out his wallet, the angle caught his face for just a second.

Dale Kovacs.

"That's him," Brandon said quietly.

Haskell switched back to the parking lot view. Kovacs loaded the four boxes into the bed of his truck, climbed in, and drove away. Timestamp: 5:58 PM.

Four trail cameras. Purchased just over two hours before Sarah Carpenter was abducted.

Brandon felt that familiar sensation—pieces clicking together. Not complete yet. Not enough for a warrant. But getting closer.

"Can you tell what specific model he bought?" Matt asked.

Haskell squinted at the screen. "Looks like the Bushnell Trophy Cam. Good cameras. Motion-activated, infrared night vision, takes both photos and video. Hunters love them. We sold a lot of them that spring."

"Do you keep records of what customers buy?"

"If they pay with a card, yeah. Cash purchases we don't track by name unless they use a loyalty card."

"Could you check if Kovacs paid with a card?"

Haskell pulled up a different program and typed for a moment. "Yeah. Credit card purchase. April sixteenth, 5:55 PM. Four Bushnell Trophy Cam HD cameras and two eight-packs of AA batteries. Total came to two hundred thirty-six dollars and forty-seven cents."

Brandon looked at Matt. "That's specific. He knew exactly what he wanted."

"And he bought batteries," Matt added. "He was planning to set them up right away."

Haskell looked between them. "You think Dale did something to Sarah?"

"We're investigating all possibilities," Brandon said carefully. "Would you be willing to provide us with a copy of that transaction record?"

"I can print you a receipt. That's public information—what someone bought. The video footage you'll need a warrant for."

"The receipt is enough for now," Matt said. "We appreciate your cooperation."

Haskell printed the receipt and handed it to Matt. "Dale's always been a little strange, but I never figured him for... you know. He always seemed harmless. Quiet."

"They usually do," Brandon said.

They left the Rural King with the receipt and a timestamp that put Kovacs buying surveillance equipment two hours before Sarah disappeared. Combined with his truck matching the description from the Crossroads, his uncomfortable relationship with Sarah, his suspicious reading materials, and the feeling Brandon couldn't shake about that barn—it was adding up.

But it still wasn't enough.

"Where to now?" Matt asked as they got back in the car.

Brandon checked his watch. Two-thirty. "Back to the motel. We need to compile everything we have and figure out our next move. Dunham said he'd have the original case files ready tomorrow. Maybe there's something in his notes we can use."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out where Kovacs placed those cameras. Because that's where the answer is."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had started again, light but persistent. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about trail cameras and barns and guilt.

About the difference between knowing something and proving it.

About Sarah Carpenter, who just wanted to go to college and study English and become a librarian. Who called her mom to say she'd be late. Who recognized someone she shouldn't have trusted.

Somewhere in Parke County, four trail cameras were watching something. Recording movement. Gathering evidence.

Brandon just had to figure out where.

And what they'd been watching for the past eighteen months.
