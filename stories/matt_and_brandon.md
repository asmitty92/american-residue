# Prologue
**Wednesday October 22, 2008 4:00PM**

The Crossroads Mini-Mart sat at the intersection of County Road 400 and State Route 39, three miles south of Thorndale, Indiana. It was the kind of place that survived on lottery tickets, fountain drinks, and the handful of locals who stopped for gas on their way to somewhere else. The building hadn't been updated since the early nineties—faded red brick, a hand-painted sign advertising "Live Bait & Tackle," and a payphone mounted on the exterior wall that hadn't worked in over a decade.

The black sedan pulled into the gravel lot at four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon in October. Two men climbed out. The first, wearing pressed khakis and a navy button-down with the sleeves rolled precisely to mid-forearm, surveyed the property with the systematic attention of someone cataloging details. The second wore khakis that looked like they'd been slept in and a wrinkled gray oxford shirt untucked on one side. He stood by the passenger door for a long moment, staring at the building.

A sheriff's deputy leaned against his cruiser near the entrance, arms crossed. He straightened when he saw them approaching.

"You the FBI?" he asked.

The first man extended his hand. "Agent Ellis. This is Agent Gray."

The deputy shook Ellis's hand, then nodded at Gray, who had moved past them toward the building without acknowledging the introduction. "He always like that?"

"Usually," Ellis said. "You're Deputy...?"

"Kowalski. I was first on scene back in April of last year." He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket and offered it. Ellis declined. "Sheriff said you wanted to see where it happened. Not much to see after eighteen months."

"We appreciate you meeting us." Ellis glanced back at Gray, who stood near the payphone, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as if listening to something. "Can you walk me through what we know?"

Kowalski unwrapped a piece of gum. "Victim was Sarah Carpenter. Twenty-two. Worked at the public library in town. April sixteenth, last year, around eight-fifteen in the evening. She stopped here after her shift." He gestured toward the building. "Witness was Travis Brennan. He was inside getting cigarettes when it happened."

"They knew each other?"

"Small town. Everybody knows everybody. They weren't close, but he recognized her car in the lot." Kowalski pointed to a spot near the side of the building. "She parked over there. Security camera shows her walking to the payphone. Car wouldn't start, apparently, and her cell was dead. She called AAA first before going inside to use the restroom, then came out to make another call while she waited."

Ellis looked at the payphone. Gray was closer to it now, standing maybe two feet away, still motionless. "The camera caught the abduction?"

"Partial. Camera's mounted above the door, faces the pumps and the front lot. Picks up the edge of where the phone is. We got her walking over, then about three minutes of her on the phone. Then a pickup truck pulls in—older model, dark color, can't make out the plate—and parks between her and the camera. Blocks most of the view."

"But you see something."

"Movement. Looks like someone gets out of the driver's side. Thirty seconds later, the truck pulls out. Heads south on 39. Sarah's gone. Her purse was still by the phone. Keys in her car."

"What was Brennan doing during this?"

"Inside, like I said. Paying for cigarettes. He comes out maybe a minute after the truck leaves, sees her purse on the ground, no Sarah. Called 911 at eight-nineteen."

Ellis made a note on his phone. "Any leads on the truck?"

"Dark green or dark blue Chevy Silverado, probably mid-to-late nineties. We put out a BOLO, checked every registration in three counties. Found seventeen trucks that matched. Talked to every owner. Nothing stuck."

Gray had moved to the door of the mini-mart. He stood in the entrance, looking back toward where the payphone was mounted on the wall. The angle put the phone about thirty feet from the door, slightly around the corner of the building.

"And no trace of Sarah since?"

"Nothing. No activity on her bank cards, no phone pings, no sightings. It's like she disappeared." Kowalski folded the gum wrapper into a small square. "Sheriff reopened it as a cold case last month. That's when he reached out to you guys."

Ellis thanked him and walked toward the mini-mart. Gray had gone inside. Through the window, Ellis could see him standing near the register, talking to the clerk—a heavyset man in his sixties wearing a Colts jersey.

"That's Marv," Kowalski said, following Ellis's gaze. "Owns the place. He was working that night too."

Inside, the store smelled like stale coffee and air freshener. A radio played country music at low volume. Gray stood with his back to the door, nodding as Marv spoke.

"—told the sheriff the same thing," Marv was saying. "Didn't see nothing. I was stocking the cooler in back when Travis came in. Rang him up, he left. Maybe ninety seconds total. By the time I looked out the window again, that truck was gone."

"You didn't hear anything?" Gray asked. His voice was quiet, even.

"Like what?"

"A scream. A car door. Anything."

Marv shook his head. "Radio was on. And my hearing's not what it used to be."

Gray turned and walked past Ellis without a word, heading back outside. Ellis exchanged a look with Marv—apologetic, professional—and followed.

Outside, the afternoon light was starting to fade. Gray stood by the payphone again. He had taken his hands out of his pockets. His fingers brushed the metal surface of the phone's cradle.

"I need some time here," Gray said when Ellis approached.

"How long?"

"An hour. Maybe two."

Kowalski shifted his weight. "You want me to stick around?"

"No," Gray said. "I work better alone."

The deputy looked to Ellis, who nodded. "We'll call if we need anything. Thanks for your time."

After Kowalski drove off, Ellis walked back to the sedan and leaned against the hood. The sun hung low over the fields to the west, casting long shadows across the gravel lot. Gray stood motionless by the payphone, his hand resting on the receiver. From a distance, it looked like he might be making a call himself.

Ellis checked his watch. Four forty-seven. He pulled out his phone and opened the case file, scrolling through the details again. Witness statements. Security footage stills. The timeline. He'd read it all a dozen times on the drive down from Indianapolis.

When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.

Ellis knew better than to interrupt. He returned to the file, reading the same information he'd already memorized, waiting for whatever it was that Gray did in these moments.

The sun dropped lower. The temperature fell. Ellis grabbed his jacket from the car and put it on.

At six-fifteen, when the sky had gone purple and the security light above the mini-mart door had flickered on, Gray finally stood. He walked back to the car slowly, hands back in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Ellis asked.

Gray opened the passenger door but didn't get in. He stood there, looking back at the payphone.

"She knew him," Gray said.

"The abductor?"

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until it was too late."

Ellis waited, but Gray offered nothing else. He climbed into the car and closed the door.

They drove back to Thorndale in silence as the last light bled from the sky.

# Chapter One
**Wednesday Evening**

The Bluebird Diner sat on the corner of Main and Second in Thorndale, a chrome-sided relic from the fifties with cracked vinyl booths and a rotating pie case by the register. Matt pulled into the gravel parking lot at seven forty-five, following the hand-lettered sign that promised "Home Cooking & Cold Beer." The interior glowed warm yellow through the windows. Only three other cars in the lot—locals, probably, based on the Purdue and Indiana State decals in the back windows.

Brandon was already inside when Matt walked through the door. He'd taken a booth near the back, away from the handful of other customers scattered along the counter. A laminated menu sat untouched in front of him. He stared at the table surface like he was reading something written there.

Matt slid into the opposite side of the booth. "You order yet?"

"No." Brandon looked up. His eyes had that unfocused quality they got after he spent time at a scene. "Waiting for you."

A waitress appeared—sixties, reading glasses on a chain, nametag that said Dottie. She pulled an order pad from her apron. "Coffee?"

"Please," Matt said. "And a Coke for him."

Brandon didn't correct him. Matt had learned his patterns over the past three years. Coffee after midnight when they were working late. Coke any other time. Water if he was trying to think through something complicated.

"We got meatloaf tonight," Dottie said. "Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. Chef's special."

Matt ordered the meatloaf. Brandon asked for a burger, no pickles. Dottie collected the menus and shuffled back toward the kitchen.

"So," Matt said when she was out of earshot. "She knew him."

Brandon nodded. He picked up a sugar packet from the ceramic holder and turned it over in his fingers. "Not well. But familiar enough that she didn't panic when he approached."

"How familiar? Friend? Coworker? Someone she saw around town?"

"Somewhere in that range." Brandon set the sugar packet down. "She was surprised to see him there. That part didn't make sense to her."

Matt pulled out his phone and opened the case file. He'd downloaded everything the sheriff's office had sent over—witness statements, security footage stills, the initial investigation reports. "Kowalski said the camera caught her on the phone for about three minutes before the truck pulled in. Who was she calling?"

"Her mother. Telling her the car broke down and she'd be late getting home." Brandon paused. "AAA said forty-five minutes to an hour for the tow. She wasn't worried. Just annoyed."

Matt scrolled through the file. The phone records confirmed it—one call to AAA at 8:12 PM, lasted two minutes. Second call to a number registered to Linda Carpenter at 8:14 PM, lasted three minutes. Third call placed at 8:17 PM to a number that belonged to someone named Jessica Holt.

"Who's Jessica Holt?"

"Friend from high school. Sarah was calling to see if Jessica could give her a ride home instead of waiting for the tow truck." Brandon's fingers drummed once against the table. "The call went to voicemail. Sarah was leaving a message when the truck arrived."

Matt made a note. "So she's mid-voicemail, not paying full attention. Someone pulls up in a truck. Someone she recognizes. He gets out, walks over. She's not alarmed because she knows him. Then what?"

"Then she realizes something's wrong."

"What makes her realize?"

Brandon was quiet for a moment. His gaze drifted toward the window, where the last of the daylight had faded completely. "The way he was looking at her. The way he moved. She tried to end the call. Dropped the phone."

Dottie returned with their drinks. Matt thanked her. Brandon ignored his Coke.

"So we're looking for someone local," Matt said. "Someone Sarah would recognize on sight. Male. Drives or has access to a dark green or blue Chevy Silverado from the nineties."

"Mid-thirties to early fifties, probably. Based on the truck and the way he moved."

Matt looked up. "You got that from the security footage?"

"Partial. The way he got out of the truck, walked around to the passenger side. Confident but not young. Steady on his feet."

Matt had watched the same footage half a dozen times. The angle was poor, most of the action obscured by the truck itself. He could see movement, shadows, but nothing that told him about the suspect's age or gait. Brandon always saw more. Or claimed to.

"What else?" Matt asked.

"I'm pretty sure this wasn't opportunistic. That he knew she'd be there."

"How could he know that? The car breaking down was random."

Brandon shook his head. "The car didn't break down. He sabotaged it."

Matt set his phone on the table. "That wasn't in any of the reports."

"It wouldn't be. They towed her car to a lot in town, figured they'd deal with it later if Sarah turned up. After a few months they probably sold it for scrap or parts. But the timing's too convenient. Car that's been running fine suddenly won't start right as she's leaving work? He was watching. Waiting for the right moment. He did something to the engine or the battery while she was inside the library."

"That's a big assumption."

"It's the only thing that makes sense." Brandon finally looked at his Coke but didn't drink it. "He knew her routine. Knew she'd stop at the Crossroads for gas on her way home. Knew she'd use the payphone if her cell died."

"Her cell died too?"

"Battery was dead when they found her purse. Another convenience."

Matt leaned back in the booth. Three years working with Brandon Gray, and he still couldn't pin down how his partner assembled these narratives. Sometimes it felt like guesswork elevated to an art form. Other times—most times—it turned out to be uncannily accurate.

"Okay," Matt said. "Let's say you're right. He tampered with her car. Drained her phone battery or took it and replaced it with a dead one. He's been planning this. Which means he's someone who had access to her car and her phone. Someone close enough to learn her routine."

"Or someone who's been watching her long enough to know it without being close."

"Stalker?"

"Possibly."

Dottie brought their food. The meatloaf came swimming in brown gravy, with real mashed potatoes—not the instant kind—and green beans that still had some snap to them. A basket of rolls arrived with actual butter, not the plastic packets. Brandon's burger was thick and hand-formed, cheese melted perfectly over the edges. The kind of food that justified a small town diner's existence.

"So where do we start?" Matt asked. "Coworkers at the library? Regular customers? Ex-boyfriends?"

"Start with people who drive that truck. Cross-reference with people who knew Sarah well enough to recognize but weren't in her close circle. Friends of friends. Parents of kids she went to school with. That age range."

Matt made notes. "Kowalski said they checked every Silverado owner in three counties. Came up empty."

"They checked registered owners. Someone could be driving their father's truck. Their employer's truck. Borrowed it from a friend." Brandon picked up his burger, examined it, set it back down. "And they were looking for someone with an obvious connection to Sarah. We're looking for someone more peripheral. Someone who'd blend in."

"That's half the town."

"Closer to a quarter. The truck narrows it. So does the age range. And the fact that he's comfortable committing a violent crime in a semi-public location." Brandon finally took a drink of his Coke. "I don't think he's done this before, but he's thought about it a lot. This act...it has meaning to him."

They ate in silence for a while. The diner had emptied out further. Just them and an older couple at the counter nursing coffee. A country song played from a speaker somewhere, too quiet to make out the words.

"This case reminds you of something," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

Brandon looked up. "What makes you say that?"

"The way you're working it. You've been different since we took the call." Matt gestured with his fork. "Usually you're clinical. Going through the steps. This one's getting to you."

Brandon was quiet long enough that Matt thought he might not answer. Then: "There was a case in Missouri. Ashford. Small town like this one. Woman was abducted from a payphone in the center of town. She was on the phone with her boyfriend because he was stuck home babysitting his little brother. He heard her get taken. Rushed out of the house and tried to get there in time."

"When was this?"

"Eighteen years ago. April." Brandon pushed his plate away. Most of the burger was still there. "Never solved. No body. No leads. Just gone."

Matt did the math. Eighteen years put it at 1990. Before he'd joined the Bureau. Before Brandon had, for that matter. "You worked that case?"

"No. I just... heard about it." Brandon's fingers found the sugar packet again. "It stayed with me."

There was something else there. Matt could see it in the way Brandon's jaw tightened, the way he wouldn't quite meet Matt's eyes. But pushing didn't work with Gray. He'd share what he wanted to share when he was ready.

"Similar circumstances don't mean the same perpetrator," Matt said carefully. "Ashford to here is what, six or seven hours?"

"Six and a half." Brandon looked toward the window again. "I know it's not the same guy. Wrong profile. And it was eighteen years ago; the Missouri perp would be too old at this point to be our guy. Plus that case had different markers. Different approach."

"But it reminds you."

"It reminds me that some of them get away with it." Brandon's voice was flat. "That some cases stay cold. That we don't always find them."

Matt watched his partner stare at nothing. In three years, he'd rarely seen Brandon like this—invested in a way that went past professional obligation. Usually Gray approached cases like logic puzzles. Interesting problems to solve, then move on to the next one. This was different. This was personal in a way Matt didn't fully understand.

"We're going to work this one right," Matt said. "Full resources. We'll stay as long as it takes. If there's a solve here, we'll find it."

Brandon nodded but didn't respond.

Dottie brought the check. Matt paid cash and left a twenty percent tip. Outside, the temperature had dropped into the forties. Matt's breath fogged in the air. Brandon stood by the car for a moment, looking back toward the diner like he'd forgotten something.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"Fine." Brandon got in the passenger seat.

They drove back to the motel—a Quality Inn just off Route 39, the only lodging near Thorndale with more than six rooms. The parking lot was nearly empty. Matt pulled into a spot near their rooms. They'd booked adjoining doubles, doors that connected in case they needed to work late or share files.

"Tomorrow we start with the library," Matt said. "Talk to her coworkers. Get a sense of who came in regularly. Who might have paid attention to her."

"And the truck owners," Brandon added. "I want to see that list from the initial investigation. Verify they actually talked to everyone."

"Agreed."

Brandon got out but didn't head toward his room. He stood in the parking lot, hands in his pockets, looking up at the sky. No moon. No stars visible through the cloud cover.

"What is it?" Matt asked.

"She was twenty-two. Had her whole life ahead of her. Working at the library because she liked being around books. Lived with her mother. Helped with the bills." Brandon's voice was quiet. "She called her mom to say she'd be late. Didn't want her to worry."

Matt didn't know what to say to that. After a moment, Brandon walked to his door, unlocked it, and went inside without another word.

Matt stood alone in the parking lot for a moment longer. The case felt heavier now than it had that morning. He checked his watch. Eight forty-three. Still early. He could review the file again, make notes, prepare for tomorrow's interviews.

Instead, he went to his room, kicked off his shoes, and lay on the bed with the lights off. Through the thin wall, he could hear the faint sound of Brandon moving around next door. A faucet running. The creak of bedsprings. Then silence.

Matt closed his eyes and tried to picture the Crossroads Mini-Mart as it had been eighteen months ago. Sarah Carpenter standing by the payphone, leaving a message for her friend. A truck pulling in. Someone familiar walking toward her. That moment of recognition, then realization. Then nothing.

Somewhere in this town, someone knew what had happened after that. Someone who drove a green or blue Silverado. Someone Sarah had recognized but hadn't been afraid of.

Until it was too late.

Matt's phone buzzed. A text from Brandon: *In case I'm wrong about this being his first time, check missing persons in Indiana and the neighboring states. 2000-present. Specifically with a similar victim profile.*

Matt typed back: *Will do. Get some sleep.*

No response.

Matt set his phone on the nightstand and stared at the ceiling. Tomorrow they'd start building the case. Interviewing witnesses. Running down leads. Doing the work.

But tonight, lying in a motel room in a town he'd never heard of until yesterday, Matt wondered about the things Brandon wasn't saying. About Missouri and payphones and cases that stayed cold.

About why some cases got to you more than others.
