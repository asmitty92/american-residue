# Prologue
**Wednesday October 19, 2011 4:00PM**

The Crossroads Mini-Mart sat at the intersection of County Road 400 and State Route 39, three miles south of Thorndale, Indiana. It was the kind of place that survived on lottery tickets, fountain drinks, and the handful of people who stopped for gas on their way to somewhere else. The building hadn't been updated since the early nineties—faded red brick, a hand-painted sign advertising "Live Bait & Tackle," and a payphone mounted on the exterior wall.

The black sedan pulled into the gravel lot at four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon in October. Two men climbed out. The air was cool and still, carrying the sweet-rot smell of harvested cornfields—that particular scent of October in the rural Midwest, somewhere between earth and decay. The first man, wearing pressed khakis and a navy button-down with the sleeves rolled precisely to mid-forearm, surveyed the property with the systematic attention of someone cataloging details. The second wore khakis that looked like they'd been slept in and a wrinkled gray oxford shirt untucked on one side. He stood by the passenger door for a long moment, staring at the building.

A sheriff's deputy leaned against his cruiser near the entrance, arms crossed. He straightened when he saw them approaching.

"You the FBI?" he asked.

The first man extended his hand. "Agent Ellis. This is Agent Gray."

The deputy shook Ellis's hand, then nodded at Gray, who had moved past them toward the building without acknowledging the introduction. "He always like that?"

"Usually," Ellis said. "You're Deputy...?"

"Kowalski. I was first on scene back in April." He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket and offered it. Ellis declined. "Sheriff said you wanted to see where it happened. Not much to see after six months later."

"We appreciate you meeting us." Ellis glanced back at Gray, who stood near the payphone, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as if listening to something. "Can you walk me through what we know?"

Kowalski unwrapped a piece of gum. "Victim was Sarah Carpenter. Twenty-two. Worked at the public library in town. Stopped here April sixteenth, around eight-fifteen in the evening. She'd just finished her shift." He gestured toward the building. "Witness was Travis Walton. He was inside getting cigarettes when it happened."

"They knew each other?"

"Small town. Everybody knows everybody. They weren't close, but he recognized her car in the lot." Kowalski pointed to a spot near the side of the building. "She parked over there. Security camera shows her walking to the payphone. Car wouldn't start, apparently, and she didn't have her cell. Left it at work, it was found at the library a few days later. She called AAA first before going inside to use the restroom, then came out to make another call while she waited."

Ellis looked at the payphone. Gray was closer to it now, standing maybe two feet away, still motionless. "The camera caught the abduction?"

"Partial. Camera's mounted above the door, faces the pumps and the front lot. Picks up the edge of where the phone is. We got her walking over, then about three minutes of her on the phone can be seen based on the shadows. Then a pickup truck drives through the frame-older model, can't see the plate—and parks right at the edge of the camera's view."

"But you see something."

"Movement. Most of it is just their shadows. Looks like someone gets out of the driver's side. Thirty seconds later, the truck pulls out. Heads south on 39. Sarah's gone. Her purse was still by the phone. Keys in her car."

"What was Walton doing during this?"

"Inside, like I said. Paying for cigarettes. He comes out maybe a minute after the truck leaves, sees her purse on the ground, no Sarah. Called 911 at eight-nineteen."

Ellis made a note on his phone. "Any leads on the truck?"

"Chevy Silverado. 10 to 15 years old based on the body style. Dark colored. We put out a BOLO, checked every registration in three counties. Found twenty-seven trucks that matched. Talked to every owner. Nothing stuck."

Gray had moved to the door of the mini-mart. He stood in the entrance, looking back toward where the payphone was mounted on the wall. The angle put the phone about thirty feet from the door, slightly around the corner of the building.

"And no trace of Sarah since?"

"Nothing. No activity on her bank cards, no sightings. It's like she vanished into thin air." Kowalski folded the gum wrapper into a small square. "Sheriff reopened it as a cold case last month. That's when he reached out to you guys."

Ellis thanked him and walked toward the mini-mart. Gray had gone inside. Through the window, Ellis could see him standing near the register, talking to the clerk—a heavyset man in his fifties wearing a Colts jersey.

"That's Marv," Kowalski said, following Ellis's gaze. "Owns the place. He was working that night too."

Inside, the store smelled like stale coffee and air freshener. A radio played country music at low volume. Gray stood with his back to the door, nodding as Marv spoke.

"—told the sheriff the same thing," Marv was saying. "Didn't see nothing. I was stocking the cooler in back when Travis came in. Rang him up, he left. Maybe ninety seconds total. By the time I looked out the window, that truck was gone."

"You didn't hear anything?" Gray asked. His voice was quiet, even.

"Like what?"

"A scream. A car door. Anything."

Marv shook his head. "Radio was on. And my hearing's not what it used to be."

Gray turned and walked past Ellis without a word, heading back outside. Ellis exchanged a look with Marv—apologetic, professional—and followed.

Outside, the afternoon light was starting to fade. Gray stood by the payphone again. He had taken his hands out of his pockets. His fingers brushed the metal surface of the phone's cradle.

"I need some time here," Gray said when Ellis approached.

"How long?"

"At least an hour. Maybe more."

Kowalski shifted his weight. "You want me to stick around?"

"No," Gray said bluntly. "I work better alone."

The deputy looked to Ellis, who nodded. "We'll call if we need anything. Thanks for your time."

After Kowalski drove off, Ellis walked back to the sedan and leaned against the hood. The sun hung low over the fields to the west, casting long shadows across the gravel lot. Gray stood motionless by the payphone, his hand resting on the receiver. From a distance, it looked like he might be making a call himself.

Ellis checked his watch. Four forty-seven. He pulled out his phone and opened the case file, scrolling through the details again. Witness statements. Security footage stills. The timeline. He'd read it all a dozen times on the drive down from Indianapolis.

When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.

Ellis knew better than to interrupt. He returned to the file, reading the same information he'd already memorized, waiting for whatever it was that Gray did in these moments.

The sun dropped lower. The temperature fell. Ellis grabbed his jacket from the car and put it on.

At six-fifteen, when the sky had gone purple and the security light above the mini-mart door had flickered on, Gray finally stood. He walked back to the car slowly, hands back in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Ellis asked.

Gray opened the passenger door but didn't get in. He stood there, looking back at the payphone.

"She knew him," Gray said.

"The abductor?"

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until it was too late."

Ellis waited, but Gray offered nothing else. He climbed into the car and closed the door.

They drove back to Thorndale in silence as the last light bled from the sky.

# Chapter One
**Wednesday Evening**

The Bluebird Diner sat on the corner of Main and Second in Thorndale, a chrome-sided relic from the fifties with cracked vinyl booths and a rotating pie case by the register. Matt pulled into the gravel parking lot at seven forty-five, following the hand-lettered sign that promised "Home Cooking & Cold Beer." The interior glowed warm yellow through the windows. Only three other cars in the lot—locals, probably, based on the Purdue and Indiana State decals in the back windows.

Brandon was already inside when Matt walked through the door. He'd taken a booth near the back, away from the handful of other customers scattered along the counter. A laminated menu sat untouched in front of him. He stared at the table surface like he was reading something written there.

Matt slid into the opposite side of the booth. "You order yet?"

"No." Brandon looked up. His eyes had that unfocused quality they got after he spent time at a scene. "Waiting for you."

A waitress appeared—sixties, reading glasses on a chain, nametag that said Dottie. She pulled an order pad from her apron. "Coffee?"

"Please," Matt said. "And a Coke for him."

Matt had learned Brandon's patterns over the past three years. Coffee first thing in the morning and after midnight when they were working late. Coke any other time. Water if he was trying to think through something complicated.

"We got pork chops tonight," Dottie said. "Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. Chef's special."

"That sounds good. I'll have that."

Brandon asked for a burger, no pickles. Dottie collected the menus and shuffled back toward the kitchen. 

Matt's fingers tapped out a steady rhythm on the table top in the silence that followed. Waiting to see if Brandon had anything to say.

"So," Matt said when she was out of earshot. "She knew him."

Brandon nodded. He picked up a sugar packet from the ceramic holder and turned it over in his fingers. "Not well. But familiar enough that she didn't panic when he approached."

"How familiar? Friend? Coworker? Someone she saw around town?"

"Somewhere in that range." Brandon set the sugar packet down. "She was surprised to see him there. That part didn't make sense to her."

Matt pulled out his phone and opened the case file. He'd downloaded everything the sheriff's office had sent over—witness statements, security footage stills, the initial investigation reports. "Kowalski said the camera caught her on the phone for about three minutes before the truck pulled in. Who was she calling?"

"Her mother. Telling her the car broke down and she'd be late getting home." Brandon paused. "AAA said forty-five minutes to an hour to get someone out. She wasn't worried. Just annoyed."

Matt scrolled through the file. The phone records confirmed it—one call to AAA at 8:12 PM, lasted two minutes. Second call to a number registered to Linda Carpenter at 8:14 PM, lasted three minutes. Third call placed at 8:17 PM to a number that belonged to someone named Jessica Holt.

"Who's Jessica Holt?"

"Friend from high school. Sarah was calling to see if Jessica could give her a ride home instead of waiting for the tow truck." Brandon's fingers drummed once against the table. "The call went to voicemail. Sarah was leaving a message when the truck arrived."

Matt made a note. "So she's mid-voicemail, not paying full attention. Someone pulls up in a truck. Someone she recognizes. He gets out, walks over. She's not alarmed because she knows him. Then what?"

"Then she realizes something's wrong."

"What makes her realize?"

Matt noticed the quiet tension that filled Brandon's face, his gaze drifting toward the window, where the last of the daylight had faded completely. "The way he was looking at her. The way he moved. She tried to end the call. Dropped the phone."

Dottie returned with their drinks. Matt thanked her. Brandon ignored his Coke.

"So we're looking for someone local," Matt said. "Someone Sarah would recognize on sight. Male. Drives or has access to a dark colored Chevy Silverado from the nineties."

"Mid-thirties to early fifties, probably. Based on the truck and the way he moved."

Matt looked up. "You got that from the security footage?"

"Partial. The way he got out of the truck, walked around to the passenger side. Confident but not young. Steady on his feet."

Matt had watched the same footage half a dozen times. The angle didn't quite catch the payphone, most if the action had take place right at the periphery. He could see movement, shadows, but nothing that told him about the suspect's age or gait. Brandon always saw more. Or claimed to.

"What else?" Matt asked.

"I'm pretty sure this wasn't opportunistic. That he knew she'd be there."

"How could he know that? The car breaking down was random."

Brandon shook his head. "The car didn't break down. He sabotaged it."

Matt set his phone on the table. "That wasn't in any of the reports."

"It wouldn't be. They towed her car to a lot in town, figured they'd deal with it later if Sarah turned up. After a few months they probably sold it for scrap or parts. But the timing's too convenient. Car that's been running fine suddenly won't start right as she's leaving work? He was watching. Waiting for the right moment. He did something to the engine or the battery while she was at the library."

"That's a big assumption."

"It's the only thing that makes sense." Brandon finally looked at his Coke but didn't drink it. "He knew her routine. Knew she'd stop at the Crossroads for gas on her way home. Knew she'd use the payphone if she didn't have her cell phone."

"Her cell phone?"

"It was missing when they found her purse. It was eventually found at the library but not until a week later. I think he stole it the day she disappeared and then planted it back at the library later."

Matt leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table. His hands slowly massaged his temples. Three years working with Brandon Gray, and he still couldn't pin down how his partner assembled these narratives. Sometimes it felt like guesswork elevated to an art form. Other times—most times—it turned out to be uncannily accurate.

"Okay," Matt said. "Let's say you're right. He tampered with her car. Swiped her phone. He's been planning this. Which means he's someone who had access to her car and her phone. Someone close enough to learn her routine."

"Or someone who's been watching her long enough to know it without being close."

"Stalker?"

"Possibly."

Dottie brought their food. The pork chop was thick cut and not overdone, with real mashed potatoes—not the instant kind—and green beans that still had some snap to them. A basket of rolls arrived with actual butter, not the plastic packets. Brandon's burger was thick and hand-formed, cheese melted perfectly over the edges. The kind of food that justified a small town diner's existence.

"So where do we start?" Matt asked. "Coworkers at the library? Regular customers? Ex-boyfriends?"

"Start with people who drive that truck. Cross-reference with people who knew Sarah well enough to recognize but weren't in her close circle. Friends of friends. Parents of kids she went to school with. That age range."

Matt made notes. "Kowalski said they checked every Silverado owner in three counties. Came up empty."

"They checked registered owners. Someone could be driving their father's truck. Their employer's truck. Borrowed it from a friend. And with a truck that old, it could be unregistered with stolen plates." Brandon picked up his burger, examined it, set it back down. "And they were looking for someone with an obvious connection to Sarah. We're looking for someone more tangential. Someone who'd blend in."

"That's half the town."

"Closer to a quarter. The truck narrows it. So does the age range. And the fact that he's comfortable committing a violent crime in a semi-public location." Brandon finally took a drink of his Coke. "I don't think he's done this before, but he's thought about it a lot. This act...it has meaning to him."

They ate in silence for a while. The diner had emptied out further. Just them and an older couple at the counter nursing coffee. A country song played from a speaker somewhere, too quiet to make out the words.

"This case reminds you of something," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

Brandon looked up. "What makes you say that?"

"The way you're working it. You've been different since we took the call." Matt gestured with his fork. "Usually you're clinical. Going through the steps. This one's getting to you."

Brandon was quiet long enough that Matt thought he might not answer. Then: "There was a case in Missouri. Ashford. Small town like this one. Woman was abducted from a payphone in the center of town. She was on the phone with her boyfriend because he was stuck home babysitting his little brother. He heard her get taken. Rushed out of the house and tried to get there in time. Saw the vehicle fleeing, but couldn't catch it."

"When was this?"

"Twenty-one years ago back in June." Brandon pushed his plate away. Most of the burger was still there. "Never solved. No body. No leads. Just gone."

Matt did the math. Twenty-one years put it at 1990. His Air Force years, before he'd joined the Bureau. Brandon would have been a kid. "You worked this as a cold case?"

"No. I just... heard about it." Brandon's fingers found the sugar packet again. "It stayed with me."

There was something else there. Matt could see it in the way Brandon's jaw tightened, the way he wouldn't quite meet Matt's eyes. Pushing didn't usually work with Gray, but he let his curiousity get the better of him.

"Were there any witnesses other than the boyfriend?" Matt asked casually. Are they definitely sure he wasn't involved."

Matt saw anger flare suddenly in Brandon's deep green eyes.

"The boyfriend had nothing to do with it. He's beyond reproach."

Matt was taken aback. Brandon's hands had clenched into fists on the table. He noticed, seemed to realize it, and deliberately relaxed them.

Matt chose his next words carefully.

"Similar circumstances don't mean the same perpetrator," Matt said carefully. "Ashford to here is what, six or seven hours?"

"Six and a half." Brandon looked toward the window again. "I know it's not the same guy. Wrong profile. And it was twenty-one years ago; the Missouri perp would be too old at this point to be our guy. Plus that case had different markers. Different approach."

"But it reminds you."

"It reminds me that some of them get away with it." Brandon's voice was flat. "That some cases stay cold. That we don't always find them."

Matt watched his partner stare at nothing. In three years, he'd rarely seen Brandon like this—invested in a way that went past professional obligation. Usually Gray approached cases like logic puzzles. Interesting problems to solve, then move on to the next one. This was different. This was personal in a way Matt didn't fully understand.

"We're going to work this one right," Matt said. "Full resources. We'll stay as long as it takes. If there's a solve here, we'll find it."

Brandon nodded but didn't respond.

Dottie brought the check. Matt paid cash and left a twenty percent tip. Outside, the temperature had dropped into the forties. Matt's breath fogged in the air. Brandon stood by the car for a moment, looking back toward the diner like he'd forgotten something.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"Fine." Brandon got in the passenger seat.

They drove back to the motel—a Quality Inn just off Route 39 on the way to Blackburn, the closest lodging to Thorndale with more than six rooms. The parking lot was nearly empty. Matt pulled into a spot near their rooms. They'd booked adjoining doubles, doors that connected in case they needed to work late or share files.

"Tomorrow we start with the library," Matt said. "Talk to her coworkers. Get a sense of who came in regularly. Who might have paid attention to her."

"And the truck owners," Brandon added. "I want to see that list from the initial investigation. Verify they actually talked to everyone."

"Agreed."

Brandon got out but didn't head toward his room. He stood in the parking lot, hands in his pockets, looking up at the sky. No moon. No stars visible through the cloud cover.

"What is it?" Matt asked.

"She was twenty-two. Had her whole life ahead of her. Working at the library because she liked being around books. Lived with her mother. Helped with the bills." Brandon's voice was quiet. "She called her mom to say she'd be late. Didn't want her to worry."

Matt didn't know what to say to that. After a moment, Brandon walked to his door, unlocked it, and went inside without another word.

Matt stood alone in the parking lot for a moment longer. The case felt heavier now than it had that morning. They usually did, but this was different. He checked his watch. Eight forty-three. Still early. He could review the file again, make notes, prepare for tomorrow's interviews.

Instead, he went to his room, kicked off his shoes, and lay on the bed with the lights off. Through the thin wall, he could hear the faint sound of Brandon moving around next door. A faucet running. The creak of bedsprings. Then silence.

Matt closed his eyes and tried to picture the Crossroads Mini-Mart as it had been six months ago, in spring. Sarah Carpenter standing by the payphone, leaving a message for her friend. A truck pulling up. Someone familiar walking toward her. That moment of recognition, then realization. Then nothing.

Somewhere in this town, someone knew what had happened after that. Someone who drove a Silverado. Someone Sarah had recognized but hadn't been afraid of.

Until it was too late.

Matt's phone buzzed. A text from Brandon: *In case I'm wrong about this being his first time, check missing persons in Indiana and the neighboring states. 2000-present. Specifically with a similar victim profile.*

Matt typed back: *Will do. Get some sleep.*

No response.

Matt set his phone on the nightstand and stared at the ceiling. Tomorrow they'd start building the case. Interviewing witnesses. Running down leads. Doing the work.

But tonight, lying in a motel room in a town he'd never heard of until yesterday, Matt wondered about the things Brandon wasn't saying. About Missouri and payphones and cases that stayed cold.

About why some cases got to you more than others.

# Chapter Two
**Thursday Morning**

Brandon Gray had been awake since four-thirty. Not unusual. Sleep came in fragments on cases like this—two hours, then awake, then another hour if he was lucky. He'd learned to work with it rather than fight it.

By six he was dressed and downstairs in the Quality Inn's breakfast area, a corner room off the lobby with industrial carpet and fluorescent lights that hummed at a frequency most people didn't notice. Brandon noticed. He'd positioned himself at a table in the back corner, away from the windows, with a clear view of the entrance and the coffee station.

The case files were spread across the table in front of him, arranged in an order that would look haphazard to anyone else. Witness statements on the left, organized by proximity to the scene. Security footage stills in the center, sequenced by timestamp. Victimology on the right—Sarah Carpenter's life in documents and photographs.

He had a cup of black coffee cooling in front of him. It was surprisingly good quality for a hotel, some regional brand.

Three other people occupied the breakfast area. An older couple near the waffle maker, talking quietly about their grandson's football game. A man in his forties at a table by the window, reading the local newspaper while eating a bagel. The man wore no wedding ring but had a tan line that suggested there should be one there. Recent divorce, or possibly a man looking to cheat while on the road.

Brandon returned his attention to the files. Sarah Carpenter's face looked up at him from her library ID photo—twenty-two, dark blonde hair pulled back, blue eyes, the kind of smile that made you want to smile back. She'd started at the Blackburn Public Library three years ago, right after high school. Circulation desk, children's programs, whatever needed doing. Her supervisor called her reliable. Her coworker called her sweet. Her mother called her gone.

The phone records showed her last three calls: AAA at 8:12 PM, her mother at 8:14 PM, Jessica Holt at 8:17 PM. The third call had gone to voicemail. The transcript of the recovered message was in the file. *Hey Jess, it's me. My car died at the Crossroads and I'm waiting for a tow but it's going to be like an hour and I'm freezing out here. Any chance you could—*

The message cut off mid-sentence. Not because she'd hung up. Because something had interrupted her.

Someone.

Brandon picked up his coffee. It had gone lukewarm. He drank it anyway.

He thought about the moments before an abduction. The victim's awareness shifting from mundane annoyance to confusion to fear. That transition was usually fast—split second, not seconds. But Sarah had known her abductor. That changed the timeline. Extended it. She'd had time to realize something was wrong before it was too late to run.

The physiological response to that realization: elevated heart rate, adrenaline spike, pupils dilating, time distortion. Some victims later reported those seconds feeling like minutes. The brain processing threat assessment at accelerated speed. Fight, flight, or freeze.

Sarah had frozen. Or tried to talk her way out. The purse left behind suggested she hadn't run. The absence of blood at the scene suggested no immediate violence...meant she hadn't fought. She'd gone with him. Maybe thinking she still had a chance to de-escalate. To reason with someone she knew.

She'd been wrong.

Brandon set the coffee down and pulled out his phone. He opened the photos he'd taken yesterday at the Crossroads. The payphone. The angle from the mini-mart door. The spot where Sarah's car had been parked.

He'd stood there for ninety minutes, not moving, barely breathing, letting the scene settle in his mind the way it always did. Not intuition, exactly. Just intense focus. Most people looked at crime scenes and cataloged evidence. Brandon tried to reconstruct the event itself—imagining movements, psychology, the sequence of actions that left the traces behind.

In his mind, he could picture Sarah standing by the phone, receiver to her ear, shifting her weight from foot to foot because it had been a chilly spring evening and she was impatient. The truck pulling in, dark paint catching the security light. The driver's door opening, someone stepping out. Someone Sarah recognized.

Her body language changed. Still relaxed, but curious. A small wave, maybe. A question forming.

Then the shift. Subtle at first. Her posture straightening. The hand not holding the phone moving slightly away from her body—unconscious preparation to defend herself or create distance.

But by then it would have been already too late.

"You're up early."

Brandon looked up. Matt stood by the table, holding a paper plate with a waffle, some fruit, and three slices of bacon. He'd showered and shaved. His shirt was pressed, sleeves rolled evenly. Even at six-thirty in the morning, Matt Ellis looked like an FBI recruitment poster.

"Couldn't sleep," Brandon said.

Matt sat down across from him, surveying the spread of files. "Learn anything new?"

"Sarah was a creature of habit. Same route home every day. Same stop at the Crossroads for gas every Thursday after her shift. She was predictable."

"Which made her easy to watch."

"And easy to intercept." Brandon gathered the files into a stack, his system disrupted now that Matt was there. "If he tampered with her car, he did it while she was at the library. That's a narrow window. Her shift ended at eight. She left by eight-oh-five according to her coworker. Car was parked in the employee lot behind the building. He would've have had to do it after 7pm when early staff ended their day. He wouldn't have wanted to be seen."

"So he knew the library's layout. Knew where employees parked."

"Wouldn't be hard if he'd been watching Sarah." Brandon closed the last file. "We need to talk to her co-workers. See who paid attention to her. Who asked questions."

Matt cut into his waffle. "That's the plan. Library opens at ten. I talked to the head librarian yesterday. She said she'd make time for us."

Brandon nodded. He checked his watch. Seven forty-three. Two hours and seventeen minutes until the library opened. He could review the files again. Cross-reference the truck registrations with library patron records, see if any names overlapped. Start building a geographic profile of the suspect based on the abduction site and—

"You should eat something," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him.

"You didn't eat much at dinner last night. And you're going to need energy for interviews." Matt gestured toward the breakfast spread. "At least grab a banana or something."

Brandon stood. Matt was right—he often forgot to eat when he was working. His body didn't send the same hunger signals other people seemed to get. He'd go hours without noticing, then feel lightheaded and realize he'd skipped meals.

He walked to the breakfast bar and picked up a banana, a bagel, and a container of cream cheese. When he returned to the table, Matt had moved some of the files aside to make room.

They sat in silence for a few minutes. The older couple left, waving goodbye to the front desk clerk. The man by the window remained. He was focused on the screen of his phone, probably reading a text message. Brandon watched him peripherally. The way he hunched over the screen. The tension in his shoulders. Whatever he was reading wasn't good news.

"You mentioned Missouri last night," Matt said quietly. "Ashford."

Brandon peeled the banana. "Yeah."

"Want to talk about it?"

"Not much to talk about. Unsolved abduction. Twenty-one years old."

"Twenty-one years is a long time to remember a case you were far too young to have worked."

Brandon took a bite of banana. Chewed. Swallowed. "Some cases stick with you."

Matt waited, but Brandon didn't elaborate. After a moment, Matt returned to his waffle. He knew when to push and when to let something sit. Brandon appreciated that. It was one of the things that made him a good partner.

Brandon finished the banana and prepared his bagel. The cream cheese was strawberry. Too sweet, but the sugar would give him energy. He ate it mechanically while thinking about the library. Small town facility, probably built in the early 1900s. Carnegie library if he had to guess, based on the address and the architectural style common to that era. Limited staff. Everyone would know everyone. If someone had been paying unusual attention to Sarah, her coworkers would have noticed.

Unless the person had been careful. Unless they'd blended in so well that their attention seemed normal until it was too late.

"I'm driving this morning," Brandon said.

Matt looked up. "Yeah?"

"I want to take the route Sarah would have taken. Thorndale to the library in Blackburn then to the Crossroads. See what's between."

"Good idea."

They finished breakfast and went back to their rooms to gather their things. Brandon brushed his teeth, checked that his badge and weapon were secure, and grabbed his jacket. The gray oxford shirt from yesterday was wrinkled beyond saving. He'd brought a spare—light blue, still wrinkled but less noticeably. He tucked it in only on the right for access to his weapon.

At seven-fifteen they met at the car. Brandon took the driver's seat. Matt handed him a travel mug of coffee from the lobby.

"You didn't have to do that," Brandon said.

"I know."

Brandon pulled out of the parking lot and headed south on Route 39 toward Blackburn. The morning was overcast, the sky a uniform gray that suggested rain later. The temperature had dropped overnight. Frost edged the grass along the roadside.

The library was off the main drag in Blackburn on a little commercial street named Jackson. The drive took twelve minutes. Brandon timed it. It would've taken Sarah a little bit longer coming from her house in Thorndale. Probably closer to seventeen minutes. The library sat on Main Street, a red brick building with white columns and a copper-roofed dome that had turned green with age. A Carnegie library, as he'd suspected. Built 1912 according to the cornerstone.

He parked on the street and sat for a moment, looking at the building. Sarah had worked here. Had climbed these steps every day. Had made the coffee in the break room. Had shelved books and helped patrons and planned children's story time.

She'd worked the late shift, until closing every Thursday evening, Had driven home, stopping at the Crossroads for gas because it was on her way and the prices were a few cents cheaper than the station in town.

Until one Thursday when her car wouldn't start.

"We've got an hour and a half," Matt said. "Want to walk the route?"

Brandon nodded. They got out of the car and walked around to the back of the library. The employee parking lot was small—six spaces, all empty now. A dumpster sat in the far corner. A security light on a pole, currently off. No cameras visible.

"He could have worked on her car here without being seen," Matt said. "Especially if he did it after dark."

"She worked until eight. Light would have been fading after seven that time of year." Brandon walked to the middle of the lot, turned in a slow circle. Trees lined the back of the property, creating a natural screen from the residential street beyond. "No witnesses. No cameras. If he knew she parked here, this would be the place."

They walked back around to the front. Jackson Street was starting to wake up—a few cars, some early morning shoppers walking the cracked sidewalk, a woman opening the bakery three doors down. The smell of fresh bread drifted on the cold air.

Brandon and Matt walked south, following the route Sarah would have driven. Past the elementary school. Past the post office. At the edge of town, Jackson Street intersected Main Street which became Route 39 once you were out of town. They stopped at the town limit sign.

"Three miles to the Crossroads from here," Matt said. "Maybe four. Farm fields on both sides. A few scattered houses. No businesses."

Brandon looked south down the empty highway. "Isolated. If he'd taken her somewhere between here and there, no one would have seen."

"But he took her from the Crossroads. In front of a witness, even if that witness was inside."

"Because that's where he knew she'd be stopped. Where she'd be vulnerable." Brandon turned back toward town. "It wasn't about isolation. It was about control. He engineered the situation so she'd have to stop exactly where he wanted her."

They walked back to the library. By the time they returned, it was nine-fifty. A few cars had filled the parking lot. Lights were on inside the building.

Matt checked his watch. "Ten minutes."

Brandon sat on the front steps. The stone was cold through his pants. He watched a school bus drive past, yellow against the gray morning. A dog barked somewhere nearby. Normal sounds in a normal town where something terrible had happened.

At ten o'clock exactly, they climbed the steps and entered the library.

The interior carried the unmistakable smell of old books. Wooden floors, high ceilings, tall frosted glass windows that let in weak daylight. The circulation desk stood directly ahead. To the left, rows of stacks. To the right, a reading area with tables and chairs. A children's section in the back corner, colorful and inviting.

And on the wall near the entrance, a memorial.

Brandon stopped. He hadn't expected this, though he should have. Small towns remembered their own.

A bulletin board with a poster-sized photo of Sarah Carpenter in the center. Candid shot, not the formal ID photo he'd seen in the file. She was laughing at something off-camera, her whole face lit up. Around the photo, people had pinned notes and cards and flowers that had been pressed flat under glass. A small table beneath the board held a condolence book and a jar with fresh carnations.

Brandon approached slowly. Matt hung back, giving him space.

The notes were what you'd expect. *We miss you. You were the best. Heaven gained an angel. Thinking of you always.* Most were dated from April and May, written in the immediate aftermath of her disappearance. A few from summer. One from August.

And one from September. Last month.

Brandon leaned closer. The handwriting was different from the others—smaller, tighter, written with a ballpoint pen instead of marker. Just three words: *I'm so sorry.*

No signature.

The note had been secured with heavy-duty packing tape, the edges pressed flat against the bulletin board. Brandon pulled his phone out with one hand and fished a small switchblade from the other. He pressed the thumb slide and the blade snapped open. Using the tip carefully, he worked under the edge of the tape, lifting it just enough to see if anything was written on the back of the note.

Nothing. Just the three words on the front.

He took a photo of the note, then gently pressed the tape back down. The blade closed with another click as he pocketed the knife.

Then he opened the condolence book. More of the same—messages of grief and remembrance, names he didn't recognize but may need to cross-reference later. Teachers. Classmates. Neighbors. The whole town had signed this book.

He flipped through the pages slowly. Most entries from April. A few scattered through the summer. And on the last page with writing, another unsigned entry: *I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.*

Different handwriting than the note on the board. Or perhaps the same person trying to disguise it.

Brandon photographed this page too.

"Can I help you gentlemen?"

He turned. A woman stood behind the circulation desk—late fifties, gray hair cut short, tall for a woman, almost six feet. She wore a cardigan over a floral dress. Her expression was polite but guarded.

Matt stepped forward, showing his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We called earlier. You must be Mrs. Holcomb."

"Patricia, please." She came around the desk, shaking their hands. Her grip was firm, her palm warm. "I have a meeting room in back where we can talk privately."

Brandon glanced back at the memorial one more time before following her.

The meeting room was small—just a table with six chairs, a whiteboard on one wall, and a window that looked out onto the employee parking lot. Patricia gestured for them to sit and closed the door.

"I've been expecting you," she said, settling into a chair across from them. "Sheriff Garrett called yesterday, said the FBI was taking a fresh look at Sarah's case. I'll help however I can, though I don't know what more I can tell you than I told the deputies last spring."

Matt pulled out a notebook. "We appreciate that. Sometimes a fresh perspective can reveal new details. Can you tell us about Sarah? What kind of employee was she?"

Patricia's expression softened. "She was wonderful. Truly. Started here right out of high school, and I honestly don't know what we would have done without her. She was good with the patrons, especially the children. Patient. Kind. Always had time for people."

"What were her responsibilities?" Brandon asked.

"She worked the circulation desk mostly. Checking books in and out, helping people find materials, managing the computer stations. She also ran our children's programs—story time on Saturday mornings, the summer reading club. And she helped with shelving and processing new arrivals."

"So she interacted with a lot of people."

"Every day. We're a small library, but many of the smaller towns in the county don't have one. We stay busy. People come in for books, internet access, newspapers. Sarah knew most of the regulars by name."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Did anyone pay unusual attention to her? Ask personal questions, try to get to know her outside of work?"

Patricia hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but Brandon caught it.

"There was someone," he said.

She sighed. "Yes. Though I don't know if it means anything. We get all kinds here—lonely people looking for conversation, people who develop... attachments to staff members. It's usually harmless."

"But you noticed something about this person."

"I noticed Sarah finding excuses to be in the back when he came in. That's not like her. She was professional. She didn't avoid patrons." Patricia folded her hands on the table. "His name is Dale Kovacs. He's been coming here for years, always friendly, never caused problems. But about three months before Sarah disappeared, he started coming in more often. And he'd always end up at the circulation desk when Sarah was working."

Matt was writing. "What kind of interactions did they have?"

"Normal ones, on the surface. He'd check out books, chat about the weather, ask for recommendations. But Sarah mentioned to me once that he made her uncomfortable. She couldn't explain why. Just a feeling."

"Did she report it?" Brandon asked.

"To me, yes. I kept an eye on him after that, but I never saw him do anything inappropriate. He was just... there. Often. And he asked questions."

"What kind of questions?"

"About Sarah's schedule. Whether she'd be working on a particular day. Whether any male patrons had been showing interest in her. That sort of thing." Patricia's jaw tightened. "I should have done more. Should have talked to him directly, or asked him to use a different library. But I didn't want to make accusations if nothing was actually wrong. Small town—you have to be careful about rumors."

"You couldn't have known," Matt said gently.

Brandon wasn't listening. His attention had shifted to the window behind Patricia. The employee parking lot. The trees. The absence of security cameras.

"Does Dale Kovacs drive a truck?" he asked.

Patricia blinked. "I... yes, I think so. An older model, I believe. I don't really pay attention to cars."

"When was the last time he came in?"

"I believe I saw him recently, this week. Monday...or maybe Tuesday."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a glance.

"Is he here now?" Brandon asked.

"I'm not sure. He is often here in the mornings. Let me check the system." Patricia stood and walked to the door. "I'll be right back."

When she was gone, Matt leaned closer. "Kovacs fits the profile. Knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives an older truck."

"And he's been in recently," Brandon added. "After the case was reopened."

"Returning to follow the investigation?"

"Or feeling guilty."

Patricia returned a moment later. "He was here two days ago. Checked out three books. I have his information pulled up if you need it."

They followed her to the circulation desk. She turned the computer monitor so they could see. Dale Kovacs, 46, address on County Road 275. A small photo showed a man with plain features, receding brown hair, the kind of face that would disappear in a crowd. Current checkouts: *The Complete Guide to Tracking and Stalking*, *Topographical Maps of Southern Indiana*, and *Wilderness Survival Skills*.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his stomach.

"Can we get a copy of his borrowing history?" Matt asked. "Going back to the beginning of this year."

"I'll print it for you."

While Patricia worked the printer, Brandon scanned the library. A few patrons browsed the stacks. An middle-aged woman read a romance novel in a comfy chair. Two elderly men sat facing each other intently over a game of chess. And in the far corner, at one of the public computer terminals— 

The man from the photo. Dale Kovacs.

Brandon's hand moved to Matt's arm, a brief touch. Matt followed his gaze.

Kovacs sat with his back to them, hunched over the screen, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans. Brown hair, receding at the temples. Medium build. From this distance, he looked like anyone. Everyone. Invisible in his ordinariness.

But something was wrong. Brandon couldn't articulate it yet, but the feeling was there—the same instinct that had guided him through dozens of cases. The sense that he was looking at someone who didn't fit quite right in his own skin.

Patricia handed Matt the printout. "Anything else I can do for you?"

"Is there anyone else we should talk to? Other staff who knew Sarah?"

"Amy Chen. She worked the same shifts as Sarah sometimes. They were friendly. She's here today—comes in at eleven."

Brandon was still watching Kovacs. "Thank you, Mrs. Holcomb. We'll wait for Amy."

Patricia returned to her desk. Matt moved closer to Brandon.

"That's him?"

"Yes."

"Want to approach now?"

Brandon shook his head slightly. "Not yet. Let's see what he does."

They moved to the reading area, taking seats at a table with a clear sightline to the computer terminals. Brandon picked up a newspaper from the rack, held it open like he was reading. Matt pored over the printout of Kovacs's borrowing history.

Kovacs worked at the computer for another ten minutes. Brandon watched his posture, his movements. The way he hunched forward, shoulders tense. The way his fingers moved across the keyboard—fast, confident. He was searching for something. Or monitoring something.

At ten-forty, Kovacs stood. He logged off the computer and walked toward the circulation desk.

Brandon lowered the newspaper slightly. Now he could see Kovacs's face.

Clean-shaven. Plain features. Nothing remarkable. The kind of face you'd forget five minutes after seeing it.

Except for the eyes. Even from across the room, Brandon could see the way Kovacs looked at Patricia—too direct, too focused. Like he was cataloging her responses, analyzing her body language.

Kovacs said something. Patricia smiled politely and scanned his library card. She handed him a slip of paper—a hold notification, probably. Kovacs thanked her and turned toward the door.

He saw Brandon and Matt.

Just a glance, nothing more. But Brandon saw the recognition flicker across his face. Not recognition of them specifically—they'd never met. Recognition of what they were. Law enforcement. Investigators.

Kovacs's expression didn't change. He walked past their table, nodded politely, and continued toward the exit.

Brandon stood and walked to the window. He watched Kovacs walk to a truck parked on the side street. A late nineties model, dark blue Silverado. A match for what the security footage had shown.

Kovacs climbed in, started the engine, and drove away.

Matt stood beside Brandon. "What do you think?"

"There's something not right about him."

"Like what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon pulled out his notebook and jotted down a note: *Dale Kovacs - watch him*.

"He was in the library the day Sarah disappeared," Matt replied. "He checked out a book at six fifty-eight PM."

"What book?"

"A James Patterson novel."

A woman's voice behind them: "Can I help you find something?"

They turned. A young Asian woman stood there, mid-twenties, wearing a library staff badge. Amy Chen.

"We're with the FBI," Matt said, showing his badge. "We'd like to ask you some questions about Sarah Carpenter."

Amy's expression crumbled. "Oh. Okay. Yes, of course."

Patricia materialized from somewhere. "You can use the meeting room again."

They followed Amy back to the small room. She sat heavily in a chair, her hands twisting in her lap. Brandon noticed the way she wouldn't make eye contact, the way her shoulders curved inward. Grief, yes. But also guilt.

Matt took the lead. "How long did you work with Sarah?"

"Two years. Since I started here after college." Amy's voice was quiet. "We worked a lot of the same shifts. We weren't best friends or anything, but we were friendly."

"Did she mention anyone making her uncomfortable? Anyone who paid too much attention to her?"

Amy nodded. "There was a guy. Dale something. He came in a lot, and Sarah said he gave her weird vibes. She couldn't explain why. Just that something felt off about him."

"Did you ever interact with him?"

"A few times. He seemed normal to me. Polite, quiet. But Sarah had good instincts about people." Amy's eyes filled. "I should have paid more attention. Should have... I don't know. Been there more."

"This isn't your fault," Matt said.

"Everyone keeps saying that. But the last time I saw her, she asked if I wanted to get dinner after work that Thursday. And I said no because I had a date. If I'd said yes, if I'd been with her, maybe—"

"You couldn't have known," Brandon said. His voice was quiet but firm. "The person responsible is the only one at fault."

Amy wiped her eyes. "I just want someone to find her. To bring her home. Her mom—Mrs. Carpenter—she just wants to know what happened. That's all."

Brandon thought about the memorial board. The unsigned notes. The weight of unanswered questions.

"Did Sarah ever mention wanting to leave Thorndale?" he asked. "Going back to school, moving away?"

Amy looked up, surprised. "Yeah. She'd applied to Indiana State in Terre Haute for the fall semester. She wanted to study English first, then a master's in library science, maybe become a librarian at a university somewhere. She'd been saving up for it. She just needed more time."

Time she never got.

They talked for another twenty minutes. Amy provided names of other regulars, described Sarah's routine, confirmed that Dale Kovacs had been increasingly present in the months before the abduction. When they were done, Amy stood slowly.

"Do you think you'll find her?" she asked.

Matt's expression was kind but honest. "We're going to try."

After Amy left, Brandon and Matt sat in silence for a moment.

"Right now, Kovacs is our primary suspect," Matt said. "Everything points to him."

"Too much points to him." Brandon stared at the window. "It's too neat."

"Sometimes it is neat. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right answer."

"Maybe." Brandon stood and walked to the window. The parking lot was empty except for staff vehicles. Beyond the trees, he could see a sliver of the residential street. Normal houses. Normal lives.

"I want to see his property," Brandon said. "County Road 275. See if anything stands out."

"We'll need a warrant to search."

"I don't want to search. Just drive by. Look."

Matt checked his watch. "It's eleven-thirty. We should check in with the sheriff, see if they've made any progress on the truck owner list."

Brandon nodded but didn't move from the window. His mind was working through the timeline, the evidence, the psychology. Dale Kovacs fit the profile. Made Sarah uncomfortable. Drove the right truck. Had been here that day. Had the knowledge to tamper with her car. Asked questions about her. Returned to the library after the case was reopened.

But something was wrong. Some piece didn't fit.

"The memorial," Brandon said suddenly. "The unsigned notes."

"You think Kovacs wrote them?"

"Maybe. He wasn't secretive about his interest in Sarah. They're obviously from someone who feels guilty." He turned to face Matt. "Someone who knew something and didn't speak up. Or helped. Maybe that's Kovacs, maybe it isn't."

"An accomplice?"

"Or a witness who kept quiet."

They left the meeting room and walked back through the library. Brandon paused again at Sarah's memorial. The smiling photo. The messages from people who missed her. The flowers that someone kept fresh.

He took out his phone and photographed the entire board, zooming in on each note, each card, each detail.

When he stepped back, Matt was watching him.

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. Matt's expression held genuine concern. After three years working together, Matt had learned to read his moods, his silences, his withdrawal into himself when a case hit too close.

"I will be," Brandon said. "When we solve it."

They walked outside into the cold morning. The sky had darkened. Rain was coming.

Brandon stood on the library steps and looked south down Main Street, toward Route 39, toward the Crossroads three miles away. He thought about Sarah Carpenter making this drive every Thursday, her routine so predictable that someone had learned it, studied it, exploited it.

He thought about Missouri. About a payphone and a boyfriend who couldn't get there in time. About an ten-year-old boy who didn't understand why his big brother wouldn't talk about that night.

He thought about all the people who disappeared and never came home.

"Let's go," he said. "I want to drive the route to the Crossroads then see where Kovacs lives."

They got in the car. Brandon drove, his hands steady on the wheel, his mind already mapping the route, calculating distances, imagining scenarios.

Somewhere in this small town, Sarah Carpenter's body was waiting to be found.

And somewhere in this small town, Dale Kovacs was waiting too.

Waiting to see if they'd figure it out in time.

# Chapter Three
**Thursday Late Morning**

Matt drove this time. Brandon sat in the passenger seat with his phone out, studying the satellite view of Dale Kovacs's property on Google Maps. County Road 275 ran east-west about four miles south of Thorndale, cutting through farmland and scattered residential plots. Kovacs's address put him two miles from the nearest neighbor.

"Twelve acres," Brandon said, zooming in on the image. "House, barn, what looks like a garage or workshop. Heavily wooded on the north side."

Matt kept his eyes on the road. They'd left the library twenty minutes ago. The sky had darkened further, and the first drops of rain hit the windshield. "We're just driving by. Observing from the road. No stop, no approach."

"I know."

"I mean it, Gray. We don't have probable cause for a search warrant. We can't even knock on his door without risking complications later."

Brandon looked up from his phone. "Understood."

Matt relaxed slightly. The rain came harder. He flicked on the wipers. The rhythmic sweep was the only sound for a moment.

"So, next steps after this," Matt said. "I think we need to try for surveillance footage from businesses on Route 39 going north out of Blackburn. Gas stations, drug stores, anything with cameras that could've capture the road. If Kovacs drove that route the night Sarah disappeared, maybe someone caught his truck."

"That's six months ago. Most places don't keep footage that long."

"Some do. Worth checking." Matt felt the wheels slip a bit on the wet tar and gravel road. 

"We need to re-interview Travis Walton," Brandon added. "The witness from the Crossroads. His statement was thin."

Matt had read Walton's statement three times. Thirty-one years old, worked construction, had stopped for cigarettes. Saw Sarah's purse by the payphone, called 911. Told deputies he didn't see or hear anything. "You think he's hiding something?"

"I think he saw more than he told them. Maybe not much more, but something. Sometimes you just need to ask the right questions."

The GPS announced their turn. Matt slowed and turned onto County Road 275. The pavement was cracked and patched, weeds growing through the edges. Fields stretched out on both sides—corn stubble from the fall harvest, waiting for winter.

"Half a mile ahead," Brandon said.

Matt eased off the gas, dropping to thirty miles per hour. His pulse kicked up slightly. This was the part of the job that required control—driving past a suspect's property knowing you couldn't stop, couldn't search, couldn't do anything but look.

The first structure that appeared was a mailbox. Faded red with the numbers 6847 in peeling white paint. Matt noted it without slowing further.

"That's it," Brandon said quietly.

The property sat back from the road about a hundred feet. The driveway was gravel, rutted from use. The house itself was a small ranch-style structure, probably built in the sixties or seventies. White siding gone gray with age and weather. Black shutters. A concrete front porch with no furniture, no welcome mat, nothing that suggested anyone cared about the property's appearance.

Behind the house, partially visible through the rain, was the barn. Weathered red wood, the paint mostly gone. The roof sagged slightly in the middle. One of the large doors hung at an angle, the bottom hinge broken or missing.

Matt kept driving at a steady pace, not too slow, not too fast. Just a car passing by on a rural road.

But something felt wrong. He couldn't articulate it—no specific detail he could point to. Just a weight in his chest, a tightness that said *pay attention*. The property had the look of a place where bad things happened and nobody noticed.

Brandon had turned in his seat, looking back.

Matt drove another hundred yards, then pulled onto the shoulder and stopped.

"What are you doing?" Brandon asked.

Matt stared at the rearview mirror. Rain obscured the property now, but he could still picture it. The sagging barn. The lifeless house. The woods pressing in from the north side.

"We should knock and talk," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him. "I thought we weren't stopping."

"We're not searching. We're just following up with someone who was friendly with Sarah. Seeing if Kovacs remembered anything about that day. We know from his borrowing history that he was in the library." Matt put the car in reverse, backing carefully along the shoulder. "It's a legitimate investigative technique."

"Since when are you the one pushing boundaries?"

"Since I got a bad feeling about that barn." Matt turned into Kovacs's driveway. The gravel crunched under the tires. "You're not the only one with instincts."

Brandon said nothing, but Matt caught the slight upturn at the corner of his partner's mouth.

The driveway curved slightly, bringing them closer to the house. Matt parked about thirty feet from the front porch, leaving room to turn around quickly if needed. He killed the engine. The rain drummed on the roof.

"His truck's not here," Brandon observed.

Matt had already noticed. No vehicles visible. No lights on in the house. No movement in the windows. 

"It could be in the garage."

They got out. The rain soaked through Matt's shirt immediately. He pulled his jacket tighter and walked toward the front porch. Brandon followed a step behind. Moving slower, less bothered by the falling rain.

The porch was concrete, cracked in several places. Dead leaves had collected in the corners. A window air conditioning unit sat dark in one window, plastic sheeting taped around it for winter. The front door was white metal with a small window at eye level, covered from the inside with a curtain.

Matt knocked. Three solid raps. "Mr. Kovacs? FBI. We'd like to talk to you."

No answer. No sound from inside.

He knocked again. Waited.

Nothing.

"Not home," Matt said, stating the obvious.

Brandon had moved to the edge of the porch, looking toward the barn. The rain made it hard to see clearly, but the structure loomed dark against the gray sky.

"I'm going to look around," Brandon said.

Matt should have stopped him. Should have said they'd done their due diligence, knocked on the door, no one home, time to leave. But that feeling in his chest hadn't gone away. If anything, it had gotten stronger.

"Stay within plain view," Matt said. "Don't go inside anything."

Brandon stepped off the porch and walked toward the barn.

Matt followed, his shoes squelching in the muddy ground. The rain had turned the yard into soft earth that stuck to his soles. He could feel water running down his collar.

The barn sat about fifty yards behind the house. As they got closer, Matt could see it was in worse shape than it had looked from the road. The wood was rotted in places. Several boards had fallen away, leaving gaps in the walls. The door that hung crooked swayed slightly in the wind.

Brandon stopped about ten feet from the entrance. He stood very still, rain streaming down his face, staring at the barn.

"Gray?" Matt said quietly.

Brandon didn't answer. His expression had gone distant, unfocused. Matt recognized that look—the same one Brandon got at crime scenes, when he was processing something Matt couldn't see.

After a long moment, Brandon walked to the barn entrance. He grabbed the edge of the crooked door and pulled it open wider. It caught on its broken hinge and groaned audibly despite the rain.

"Brandon," Matt said, louder now. "We can't go in without—"

But Brandon had already stepped inside.

Matt swore under his breath and followed.

The interior was dark and smelled of rot and old hay. Rain came through gaps in the roof, creating pools on the dirt floor. Matt's eyes adjusted slowly. He could make out wooden support beams, a hayloft above, farming equipment that looked like it hadn't been used in decades. A rusted plow. Some kind of harvester with a flat tire.

Brandon stood in the center of the space, turning slowly. His breathing had changed—slower, deeper. His hands hung at his sides.

"Brandon," Matt said again. Quieter this time, almost a whisper, because something about the space demanded quiet.

"Something happened here." Brandon's voice barely audible over the rain.

Matt felt the hair on his arms stand up. The barn was just a barn. Old, rotting, abandoned. There was nothing obviously wrong with it.

But he felt it too. That same wrongness he'd felt driving past the property. Concentrated here, in this space.

Brandon walked to the back corner, where shadows were deepest. He crouched down, his hand hovering over the dirt floor without quite touching it.

"What do you see?" Matt asked.

Brandon didn't answer. He stayed crouched for what felt like a full minute, motionless except for his eyes tracking something across the floor. Then he stood and moved to one of the support beams. His fingers traced the wood about four feet up from the ground.

"We need to come back," Brandon said. "With a warrant and a forensics team."

"Based on what?"

Brandon turned to face him. In the dim light, his expression was hard to read. "She was here, Matt. Sarah was here."

"How do you—"

"She was here." Brandon's voice was flat, certain. "And this is where she died."

Matt wanted to ask how Brandon knew. Wanted concrete evidence, something he could put in a report. But Brandon was already walking toward the entrance, moving quickly now, like he needed to get out.

Matt followed him back into the rain. Brandon walked several yards away from the barn and stopped, breathing hard. Not from exertion. From something else.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

Brandon nodded, but didn't speak.

Matt looked back at the barn. Just an old structure on a rural property. Nothing obviously incriminating. Nothing a judge would accept as probable cause.

But Brandon was right. Matt felt it in his gut. Something terrible had happened in that barn.

"Let's go," Matt said. "We need to talk to the sheriff's office. Figure out how to get a legal search going."

They walked back to the car, both soaked through. Matt started the engine and turned the heat on high. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, staring straight ahead, his jaw tight.

Matt backed out of the driveway and headed toward Rockville, the county seat. Twenty-five minutes away. Where they'd meet with Chief Deputy whoever-he-was and try to explain why they needed a warrant to search a barn based on a feeling.

Neither of them spoke during the drive. The rain continued. The wipers beat their rhythm.

Matt kept thinking about the way Brandon had moved through that barn. The certainty in his voice when he said Sarah had died there.

Three years working with Brandon Gray, and Matt still didn't understand how his partner knew the things he knew.

But he'd learned to trust it.

And right now, every instinct Matt had—the normal ones, the ones based on observation and experience and gut feeling—was telling him Brandon was right.

Sarah Carpenter had been in that barn.

And their next step was to prove it.

---

The Parke County Sheriff's Office sat on the west side of Rockville's courthouse square, a two-story brick building that looked like it had been built in the seventies and never updated. Matt pulled into the visitor parking lot at twelve-fifteen. The rain had lessened to a drizzle.

"Let me do most of the talking," Matt said as they got out of the car. "At least at first."

Brandon nodded. He'd been quiet the entire drive, staring out the window at the passing farmland. His shirt was still damp from the barn, and he'd turned the heat vent directly on himself for the last ten minutes of the drive.

Inside, the building smelled like old coffee and floor wax. A reception desk sat behind bulletproof glass. A woman in her fifties with reading glasses and a sheriff's office polo looked up when they entered.

Matt showed his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We're here to see Chief Deputy—" He paused, realizing he didn't have a name.

"Dunham," the woman said. "Tom Dunham. You're the boys looking at the Carpenter case?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She picked up a phone, pressed a button. "Tom, the FBI agents are here." A pause. "Okay." She hung up and pointed to a door on their right. "Through there. Second office on the left."

The hallway was narrow, lined with photos of past sheriffs and deputies. Matt counted eight different sheriffs going back to 1952. At the end of the hall, a break room door stood open. Inside, someone was heating something in a microwave that smelled like freezer burned lasagna.

The second office on the left had a nameplate: Chief Deputy Tom Dunham. The door was open. Matt knocked on the frame anyway.

"Come in."

The office was small and tidy. A metal desk with a computer monitor, stacks of files arranged chronologically, and a bookshelf holding law enforcement manuals and what looked like case binders. The walls held certificates and commendations, most from the Joliet Police Department in Illinois.

Chief Deputy Tom Dunham stood and came around the desk. Late forties, maybe fifty. Average height and slightly overweight like an ex-athlete gone to seed. Thinning brown hair cut short. He wore khakis and a button-down shirt with a tie loosened at the collar. His handshake was firm but perfunctory.

"Tom Dunham," he said. "Sheriff Garrett said you'd be stopping by."

"Matt Ellis." Matt gestured to Brandon. "This is my partner, Brandon Gray."

Dunham shook Brandon's hand, then gestured to two chairs across from his desk. "Have a seat. Coffee?"

"We're good, thanks," Matt said.

They sat. Dunham returned to his chair and leaned back slightly, his expression neutral but guarded. Not hostile, exactly. Just the look of someone who'd seen federal agents come and go before and wasn't particularly optimistic about the outcome.

"Sheriff said the Bureau's taking a fresh look at Sarah Carpenter," Dunham said. "Six months old. That's a long time for a missing person case."

"Sometimes fresh eyes help," Matt said. "We appreciate you reaching out to us."

"That was the sheriff's call. I just work here." Dunham's tone was flat, matter-of-fact. "But yeah, I was the one who worked the case when she first disappeared. Me and Deputy Kowalski—you met him yesterday at the Crossroads."

"We did. He was helpful."

"He's a good kid. Still green, but he follows procedure." Dunham pulled a file from one of the stacks on his desk. Thick manila folder, Sarah Carpenter's name written on the tab. "I've got everything we compiled. Witness statements, security footage, the truck canvas, phone records. You probably already have copies, but if you need originals, they're here."

Matt leaned forward slightly. "We've reviewed the files. I wanted to ask about the truck canvas. Twenty-seven Chevy Silverados, black or a dark shade of blue or green, late nineties models. You talked to all the owners?"

"Every single one. Most of them personally, a few by phone if they were out of state." Dunham opened the file, flipped through pages. "Checked alibis, looked at the vehicles when we could. Nothing stood out. A couple guys were squirrelly about letting us look in their truck beds, but that turned out to be because one had an open container violation and the other was behind on registration."

"What about people who had access to those trucks but weren't the registered owners?" Brandon asked. It was the first time he'd spoken since they'd arrived.

Dunham looked at him. "Like who?"

"Family members. Employees. Friends who borrowed vehicles."

"We asked. Nobody had anything that seemed relevant." Dunham closed the file. "Look, I know what you're thinking. Small county sheriff's office, limited resources, maybe we missed something. And maybe we did. But we worked this case hard for three months. Every lead, every tip, every person who even looked at Sarah sideways. It all went nowhere."

Matt kept his tone even. "We're not here to second-guess your work, Chief Deputy. We're just trying to find new angles."

"Call me Tom." Dunham's expression softened slightly, though the guardedness remained. "And I get it. Really. This case—" He paused, looking at the file on his desk. "Sarah Carpenter was a good kid. Worked at the library, helped her mom pay bills, planning to go to college. She didn't deserve what happened to her. Her mother doesn't deserve to not know."

"You've stayed in touch with Mrs. Carpenter?" Brandon asked.

"Someone from the office checks in about once a month. Usually me. Let her know we haven't forgotten." Dunham's jaw tightened. "But six months with no leads, no body, no activity on her cards—it's hard to tell a mother we're still working it when we don't have anything to work."

Matt glanced at Brandon, then back to Dunham. "We may have a lead. A person of interest we'd like to look into further."

Dunham sat up straighter. "Who?"

"Dale Kovacs. Forty-six, lives on County Road 275. He was a regular at the library where Sarah worked. Made her uncomfortable. Drives a dark blue Silverado, late nineties model. And he was at the library the day she disappeared."

Dunham's expression didn't change, but Matt saw the recognition in his eyes. "Kovacs was on our list. We talked to him back in late April. He said he was at the library that afternoon, left around seven, went home. Lived alone, no alibi, but no direct evidence linking him to the abduction. Just happened to drive the same truck."

"Did you search his property?" Brandon asked.

"Didn't have cause. He was cooperative, answered questions, let us look in his truck. Nothing suspicious. No blood, no signs of a struggle, no personal items that didn't belong to him."

"What about his barn?" Brandon's voice was quiet, controlled.

Dunham frowned. "What about it?"

"Did you search it?"

"Drove by the property, saw the barn from the road. But there are a lot of old barns out here. Like I said, we didn't have probable cause for a search warrant. Kovacs being creepy and driving the right truck isn't enough for a judge."

Matt chose his words carefully. "We drove by his property this morning. We got a bad feeling about that barn."

Dunham looked at Matt, then at Brandon. "A bad feeling."

"Yes."

"You want me to apply for a warrant based on a bad feeling?"

"We want to find Sarah Carpenter," Brandon said. His tone was level, but there was an edge underneath. "And I think she was in that barn."

Dunham leaned back in his chair. "You *think*. Based on what evidence?"

"Kovacs fits the profile," Matt said. "He knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives the right vehicle, was present the day of the abduction. His recent library checkouts include books on wilderness survival, topographical maps, and forensic investigation techniques—"

"That's still circumstantial," Dunham interrupted. "I'm not saying it's not worth looking at. I'm saying no judge in this county is going to sign a warrant based on circumstantial evidence and a gut feeling."

"Even if that gut feeling is right?" Brandon asked.

"Even then. Because if we search without proper cause and find something, a defense attorney will get it thrown out. And if we search and don't find anything, we've violated his Fourth Amendment rights and opened the county up to a lawsuit." Dunham's voice was firm but not unkind. "I've been doing this job for twenty-six years. Twenty of those in Joliet, Illinois, where we actually had resources and case law on our side. I know how to work a case. And I know the difference between wanting to solve something and having the legal grounds to act on it."

Matt felt the frustration building but kept it off his face. "So what do you suggest?"

"Keep building the case. Interview more people. Cross-reference Kovacs's movements with Sarah's routine. Find a witness who saw his truck near the Crossroads that night. Get phone records, financial records, anything that puts him at the scene or establishes a pattern of stalking behavior." Dunham tapped the desk. "Get me something concrete, and I'll take it to Judge Morrison myself. But I'm not asking for a warrant based on vibes."

Brandon stood abruptly. "Excuse me." He walked out of the office.

Matt stayed seated, watching Dunham's reaction.

"Your partner always like that?" Dunham asked.

"Sometimes. This case is getting to him."

"It got to me too. Still does." Dunham's expression softened again. "Look, Agent Ellis—Matt—I want to help. I really do. If Kovacs is our guy, I want him in a cell. But I also want the conviction to stick. And that means doing everything by the book."

"I understand." Matt stood. "Can we get access to the original case files, including your personal notes? Sometimes there are observations that don't make it into the official reports."

"Sure. I'll have them ready for you tomorrow morning. Where are you staying?"

"Quality Inn off Route 39."

"I'll call when they're ready." Dunham walked Matt to the door. "For what it's worth, I hope your gut is right. I hope Sarah's in that barn and we can bring her home. But we have to do this right."

"Agreed."

Matt found Brandon outside, standing by the car in the drizzle. He wasn't getting in, just standing there with his hands in his pockets, staring at nothing.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"He's not wrong." Brandon's voice was flat. "We need more than what we have."

"So we get it. We re-interview Walton. We track down surveillance footage. We build the case until it's airtight."

Brandon turned to look at him. "And if Kovacs destroys evidence while we're building the case?"

"If he was going to do that, he would have done it already. It's been six months."

"Or maybe he's been waiting to see if anyone would come looking. And now we have." Brandon's jaw was tight. "We were at his property this morning. If he has cameras, he knows. If a neighbor saw us, word will get back to him. In small towns, everyone talks."

Matt hadn't thought of that. "Then we move fast. But we move legally."

Brandon didn't respond. He got in the passenger seat and closed the door.

Matt stood in the drizzle for a moment longer, thinking about the barn. About Brandon's certainty. About Dunham's very reasonable insistence on proper procedure.

About the fact that they were probably right—both of them.

He got in the car and started the engine.

"Where to?" Brandon asked.

Matt checked his watch. Eleven-forty. "Let's get lunch. Then we track down Travis Walton and see what he remembers that he didn't tell the deputies the first time."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had stopped, leaving everything wet and gray. Matt's mind was already working through the next steps. Witness interviews. Records requests. Building the legal framework that would let them do what they both knew needed to be done.

Search that barn.

Find Sarah Carpenter.

And prove that Brandon's instincts—whatever they were, however they worked—had been right all along.

# Chapter Four
**Thursday Afternoon**

Brandon finished the last bite of his gas station sandwich as Matt pulled into the construction site. Turkey and swiss on wheat bread, it provided sustenance and not much else. He'd barely noticed eating it. His mind was still in that barn, replaying the impressions that had settled over him like a weight.

The construction site sat on the north edge of Thorndale where Main Street became farmland. A sign near the entrance read "Hoosier Heritage Homes - Custom Building Since 1987." Beyond it, a concrete foundation had been poured for what would eventually be someone's house. Probably their dream house, given the size of the footprint. But today, with the rain still misting down and the sky the color of wet concrete, the site looked abandoned.

A white pickup truck was parked near a job trailer—the kind contractors used as mobile offices. The truck had "Walton Construction" painted on the door in fading letters. Matt had called ahead. Travis Walton was expecting them.

"You want me to take the lead on this one?" Matt asked as he put the car in park.

Brandon crumpled the sandwich wrapper. "I've got it."

They got out. The rain had lessened to a fine mist that hung in the air rather than falling. Brandon's shirt was still damp from the barn, and the cold settled into his bones as they walked toward the trailer.

The door opened before they reached it. A man in his early thirties stepped out, wearing work boots, jeans, and a Carhartt jacket over a flannel shirt. Dark hair, stubble that suggested he'd been too busy to shave that morning. He looked tired. Not just today-tired, but the kind of tired that came from carrying something heavy for a long time.

"Travis Walton?" Matt asked, showing his badge.

"Yeah." Walton shook both their hands. His grip was firm, calloused. "FBI, right? You boys move fast, you only called me an hour ago."

"We appreciate you making time," Matt said.

"Not like we're getting anything done today." Walton gestured at the gray sky. "Can't pour concrete in this weather. Can't frame either—lumber's too wet. Crew's at lunch. Figured I'd catch up on paperwork, but honestly I was just staring at invoices."

"This won't take long," Brandon said. "We just have some follow-up questions about the night Sarah Carpenter disappeared."

Walton's expression shifted—something between resignation and discomfort. "I already told the deputies everything I saw. Which wasn't much."

"I understand. Sometimes talking through it again helps clarify details." Brandon kept his voice even, neutral. Not pushy. Just patient. "Can we sit inside?"

Walton nodded and led them into the trailer. The interior was exactly what Brandon expected—cluttered but well organized. A desk covered with blueprints and invoices, a filing cabinet, a small coffee maker on a card table, folding chairs. The space heater in the corner worked overtime, making the air stuffy and warm. It smelled like diesel fuel and wood shavings.

Walton gestured to two folding chairs and took the desk chair for himself. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his jacket pocket, then seemed to think better of it and set them on the desk.

"You still smoke?" Brandon asked.

"Trying to quit. Been saying that for three years." Walton picked up a pen, turned it over in his fingers. Nervous energy. "That's why I was at the Crossroads that night. Ran out of cigarettes, wanted to pick up a pack that night so I could get an early start the next morning."

Brandon pulled out his notebook and a pen. "Walk me through that night. What time did you get off work?"

"Round five to five-fifteen. We'd been working a job in Brazil—that's about forty minutes southwest of here. Framing a pole barn. We wrapped up, I drove back toward Thorndale."

"Did you come straight home?"

"No. Stopped at the Rural King in Blackburn first. Needed some supplies for the next day."

Brandon made notes, letting Walton establish his own timeline. "What time were you at the Rural King?"

"It's between Brazil and Thorndale, so I probably got there around five-forty. I didn't dilly-dally—grabbed what I needed, talked to Jim for a few, then paid and left."

"Jim?"

"Jim Haskell, he's the general manager there. We talked about the last Colts game for a few minutes. That's it."

Brandon nodded, writing. "Then what?"

"Drove home. Got there around six-fifteen or twenty after. Ate some leftover pizza and watched TV. I smoked my last cigarette around eight. I wanted to get to the job site in Brazil early next day, so I didn't want to stop in the morning. The gas station in Thorndale closes at seven, so I drove down to the Crossroads. It's open till eleven."

"What route did you take to the Crossroads?"

"Main Street to Route 39, then south. Same way everybody goes."

"Did you see any other vehicles on the way?"

Walton frowned, thinking. "A few. Not many—it was a Thursday night, most people were home. There was a sedan going north as I headed south. Maybe a Honda or Toyota, something like that. And a farm truck pulled out of a driveway ahead of me, but he turned off onto County Road 400."

"What about when you got to the Crossroads?"

"Sarah's car was in the lot when I pulled in. I recognized it—she drove that little red Honda Civic, had a library bumper sticker on the back. I didn't think much of it at the time. People stop there for gas all the time."

"Where did you park?"

"By the front door. The pumps were empty, so I had my choice of spots." Walton set down the pen and picked up the cigarette pack, turning it over in his hands without opening it. "I went inside. Marv was in the cooler, but he came up front when he heard me come in. I grabbed three packs of Marlboros, paid, and left. Maybe two minutes total."

"Did you notice Sarah while you were inside?"

"No. The payphone's around the side of the building. You can't see it from inside unless you're at the window, and I wasn't paying attention to windows. I was tired. Just wanted to get my cigarettes and go home."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "When you came out, what did you see?"

"Her purse was on the ground by the payphone. The phone was off the hook, hanging down. Her car was still there, but she wasn't." Walton's jaw tightened. "I called 911 right away. Stayed on the line until Deputy Kowalski showed up."

Brandon made a note. An abduction interrupted mid-call. He'd heard about one like that before. The person on the other end of the line never stopped hearing it.

"Did you hear anything while you were inside? A scream, a car door, an engine?"

"No. Marv had the radio on. And I wasn't listening for anything. Why would I be?"

Brandon nodded, making another note. "Let me back up. When you pulled into the lot, was there any other vehicle there besides Sarah's car?"

Walton started to shake his head, then stopped. "Wait. Yeah. There was a truck parked on the far side of the building. Away from the pumps. I didn't think about it until now."

Brandon's pulse quickened, but he kept his expression neutral. "What kind of truck?"

"Chevy. Older model. Dark color-coulda been black, but I'm almost positive it was blue. There's no lights on that side of the building, but some of the lights over the pumps caught it." Walton's eyes went distant, like he was replaying the memory. "I only noticed it because it seemed like a weird place to park. The pumps were empty, the lot was empty. Why park way over there unless you didn't want to be visible from the road?"

"Did you see anyone in or near the truck?"

"No. But I wasn't looking. I assumed whoever owned it was inside the store."

Matt had his notebook out now, writing quickly. Brandon maintained eye contact with Walton. "When you came back out after buying cigarettes, was the truck still there?"

Walton closed his eyes, concentrating. "No. It was gone. I remember that now. When I saw Sarah's purse and went to call 911, I looked around to see if anyone else was there who could help. The lot was empty except for her car and mine."

"So the truck left while you were inside."

"Must have. Like I said, I was only in there two minutes. Maybe less."

Brandon made another note, his mind already working through the timeline. Sarah on the phone. Travis inside buying cigarettes. The truck pulling out with Sarah inside it. All in the space of ninety seconds, maybe two minutes.

"Did you notice anything else about the truck? Damage, bumper stickers, anything in the bed?"

Walton was quiet for a moment. Brandon watched his face—the way his eyes moved, the slight tension in his jaw. He was trying to remember, not fabricate. That was important. Witnesses who were making things up looked different. They looked up and to the left, accessing the creative parts of their brain. Walton was looking straight ahead, accessing memory.

"There was something on the back window," Walton said slowly. "One of those decals. I couldn't tell you what it was, but there was something there. Caught the light wrong, made it stand out."

"What kind of decal? Sports team? Business logo?"

"I don't know. I barely registered it. Just... something white or light-colored against the dark glass."

Brandon filed that away. "And you didn't see which direction it went when it left?"

"No. Like I said, I was inside."

"Is there anything else you remember about that night? Anything that seemed off or unusual?"

Walton shook his head slowly. "Just... I keep thinking if I'd come out of the store thirty seconds earlier at the Crossroads, maybe I could have stopped it. Maybe Sarah would still be—" His voice caught.

"This isn't your fault," Matt said. "You couldn't have known."

"Yeah, well, doesn't make it easier to sleep." Walton picked up the cigarettes again, this time pulling one out and sticking it between his lips unlit. "Is there anything else? I've got to call the crew, let them know we're done for the day."

Brandon closed his notebook. "Thank you, Mr. Walton. I appreciate you taking the time. This has been helpful."

"I have?" Walton looked genuinely surprised. "I didn't think I knew anything useful."

"Sometimes the details that don't seem important are the ones that matter." Brandon stood, and Matt followed his lead. "If you remember anything else, here's my card."

Walton took the card, studied it. "You really think you're going to find her?"

Brandon chose his words carefully. "We're going to find out what happened to her."

It wasn't quite the same thing, but it was honest.

As Brandon got up to leave, Travis spoke up again slowly.

"You know, that wasn't the only time I saw a dark colored Chevy that day. There was one at the Rural King blocking my way when I went to leave. A Silverado, dark blue. Guy was loading boxes into the back."

"Can you describe the man?"

"Average height, average build. He had a baseball cap on, kept his head down. I had to wait for him to move so I could get my truck out—he was blocking the drive." Walton looked between Brandon and Matt. "I'm not sure it was the same truck from the Crossroads, but it coulda been."

"I mighta seen the guy two hours before he took Sarah," Travis said wistfully.

"Did you get a look at his face?"

"Not really. Like I said, he had his head down. I was more focused on getting around him than looking at him." Walton ran a hand through his hair. "I should have paid more attention. Should have—"

"You had no way of knowing," Matt said quietly. "Can you remember what he was loading?"

"Boxes. Three or four of them, I think. Not huge, but he was handling them carefully. Like they were breakable or expensive."

"Were they marked? Any logos or writing you could see?"

Walton closed his eyes again, concentrating. "I don't... maybe? There might have been something printed on them, but I was too far away to read it."

"What time was this?"

"Right before I left. So around six, maybe a few minutes before."

Brandon exchanged a glance with Matt. A dark blue Silverado at the Rural King around six. At the Crossroads by eight. Two hours between.

They left Walton in his trailer and walked back to the car. The rain had stopped completely now, leaving the air cold and damp. Brandon's shoes squelched in the mud.

"Rural King at six," Matt said once they were in the car. "That gives us a place to check for surveillance footage."

"And it puts someone in a dark blue Silverado in Blackburn two hours before the abduction." Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the map. "The library's in Blackburn. So is the Rural King. If he tampered with Sarah's car while she was working, he would have had time to do it between six and seven-thirty, then drive down to the Crossroads and wait."

"What do you think he was loading at the Rural King?"

Brandon stared out at the construction site, his mind working through possibilities. "Hunting equipment, maybe. Could be trail cameras—would fit with the books Kovacs has been checking out. Wilderness survival, topographical maps. Someone planning surveillance would need equipment like that."

"That's a pretty specific conclusion from 'boxes.'"

"It's a hypothesis," Brandon said. "But it's testable. We go to the Rural King, check their transaction records, see what he bought."

Matt started the engine. "It's one-thirty. If they close at six, we've got time. But Brandon—even if we confirm someone bought trail cameras, that's still not probable cause for a warrant. We don't even know for sure it was Kovacs."

"I know. But it's another piece. And pieces add up." Brandon turned to look at his partner. "If we can identify the buyer, if we can connect him to Kovacs, if we can find out where those cameras were placed—"

"That's a lot of ifs."

"That's what investigation is."

Matt pulled out of the construction site and headed toward Blackburn. The drive would take about fifteen minutes. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about timelines and opportunities.

"You think Kovacs is working alone?" Matt asked.

"I think—" Brandon paused, choosing his words. "I think there's something about this case that doesn't add up. If Kovacs did this, why make himself so visible? Why keep checking out books that make him look guilty? Why return to the library after the case is reopened?"

"Because he's arrogant. Because he thinks he's smarter than us."

"Maybe." Brandon wasn't convinced. "Or because he's trying to solve it too."

Matt was quiet for a moment. "You think he knows who took Sarah but isn't saying?"

"I think he knows something. And whatever it is, it's eating at him." Brandon thought about the unsigned notes at the library memorial. *I'm so sorry. I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.* "Guilt is a powerful motivator. Makes people do strange things."

They drove into Blackburn, passing through downtown—a main street lined with older buildings, a few shops, a diner, the library with its Carnegie architecture and copper dome. The Rural King sat on the east edge of town, a sprawling building that sold everything from livestock feed to hardware to hunting gear and outdoor clothing.

They pulled into the parking lot. A few trucks scattered around, mostly older models with rust and dents. Working vehicles, not show pieces. Brandon scanned them automatically, looking for dark blue or black Silverados. Not expecting to find any.

Inside, the store smelled like feed and fertilizer and gun oil. A mix of rural Indiana commerce. The front area held registers and an office. To the left, hardware and building supplies. To the right, hunting and fishing gear. Straight back, livestock feed and farming equipment.

A man in his sixties stood behind the counter, wearing overalls and a John Deere cap. He looked up when they entered, his expression friendly but curious. Probably didn't get FBI agents in here often.

Matt took the lead this time. "Afternoon. We're Special Agents Ellis and Gray with the FBI. We'd like to talk to the manager about a purchase from April of this year."

The man's eyebrows went up. "Last April? That's a long time ago."

"We understand. But we're hoping your system keeps transaction records long."

"Let me get Jim. He's the general manager." The man disappeared into the back office and returned a moment later with a younger man—early forties, weathered face, the look of someone who'd worked retail long enough to be skeptical of everyone.

"Jim Haskell," he said, shaking their hands. "Hugh said you're hear about a transaction six months ago. Is this about Sarah Carpenter?"

"Yes sir," Matt said. "We understand you knew her?"

"I grew up in Thorndale with her mom. She used to come in here for gardening supplies. My kids knew Sarah, through the library. She ran most of the children's programs there. She was good with kids." Haskell's expression turned sad. "Terrible thing. You guys have a lead?"

"We're following up on several possibilities. One of them involves a customer who may have been here on April sixteenth, between five and six PM. We were hoping you could check your transaction history for the purchase."

Haskell thought for a moment. "I can probably find the transaction. You know, corporate upgraded the surveillance system to digital late last year. All footage is stored to a hard drive now. Nothing gets overwritten. Might have to delete at some point if the hard drive gets full, but that hasn't happened yet."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a meaningful look. Matt spoke first.

"Being able to see that footage would be a huge help."

"I understand." Jim said slowly. "But I think I'll have to check with corporate legal first. They're probably going to insist on a warrant or subpeona before they'll let me hand it over."

Brandon had expected this. "We can get that. But would you be willing to look at the footage with us here? We're trying to confirm whether a specific person was here that day."

Haskell considered this. Technically, looking at his own footage with law enforcement present wasn't handing it over. He could still say no, but Brandon could see him working through it.

"Who are you looking for?" Haskell asked.

"Dale Kovacs. Drives a Chevy Silverado, mid-forties, brown hair."

Haskell's expression shifted. Recognition, but not surprise. "Yeah, I know Dale. He comes in here maybe once a month. Usually for hunting gear or tools."

"Was he here on April sixteenth?"

"I couldn't tell you without checking." Haskell glanced at the office, then back to them. "All right. Come on back. But I'm not giving you copies without a warrant. We can just look."

"That's all we're asking," Matt said.

They followed Haskell into the back office. The space was cramped—desk, filing cabinets, a computer setup that looked like it had been cobbled together from parts over several years. Haskell sat at the computer and pulled up the surveillance software.

"April sixteenth, 2010?" Haskell confirmed, typing.

"Yes sir," Brandon said. "Between five and six-thirty PM if possible."

The screen showed a grid of six camera angles. Front entrance, parking lot, lumber yard, hunting section, registers, and loading dock. Haskell clicked on the parking lot view and started scrubbing through the footage at 4x speed.

Brandon watched the screen. Cars coming and going, customers in and out. The afternoon sun casting long shadows across the lot. He checked the timestamp. 5:32 PM. Then 5:41 PM. Then 5:49 PM.

"There," Matt said, pointing.

A dark blue Silverado pulled into the lot and parked near the lumber yard entrance. The driver got out—average height, average build, baseball cap pulled low. He walked toward the store entrance. Thirty seconds later, he entered the store pushing a shopping cart.

Haskell switched camera views to the hunting section. The man walked directly to the trail camera display, selected four boxes, and put them in the cart. Then he moved to the register.

"Can you get a clear shot of his face?" Brandon asked.

Haskell switched to the register camera. The man kept his head down while he paid, but when he pulled out his wallet, the angle caught his face for just a second.

Dale Kovacs.

"That's him," Brandon said quietly.

Haskell switched back to the parking lot view. Kovacs loaded the four boxes into the bed of his truck, climbed in, and drove away. Timestamp: 5:58 PM.

Four trail cameras. Purchased just over two hours before Sarah Carpenter was abducted.

Brandon felt that familiar sensation—pieces clicking together. Not complete yet. Not enough for a warrant. But getting closer.

"Can you tell what specific model he bought?" Matt asked.

Haskell squinted at the screen. "Looks like the Bushnell Trophy Cam. Good cameras. Motion-activated, infrared night vision, takes both photos and video. Hunters love them. We sold a lot of them that spring."

"Do you keep records of what customers buy?"

"If they pay with a card, yeah. Cash purchases we don't track by name unless they use a loyalty card."

"Could you check if Kovacs paid with a card?"

Haskell pulled up a different program and typed for a moment. "Yeah. Credit card purchase. April sixteenth, 5:55 PM. Four Bushnell Trophy Cam HD cameras and two eight-packs of AA batteries. Total came to two hundred thirty-six dollars and forty-seven cents."

Brandon looked at Matt. "That's specific. He knew exactly what he wanted."

"And he bought batteries," Matt added. "He was planning to set them up right away."

Haskell looked between them. "You think Dale did something to Sarah?"

"We're investigating all possibilities," Brandon said carefully. "Would you be willing to provide us with a copy of that transaction record?"

"I can print you a receipt. That's public information—what someone bought. The video footage you'll need a warrant for."

"The receipt is enough for now," Matt said. "We appreciate your cooperation."

Haskell printed the receipt and handed it to Matt. "Dale's always been a little strange, but I never figured him for... you know. He always seemed harmless. Quiet."

"They usually do," Brandon said.

They left the Rural King with the receipt and a timestamp that put Kovacs buying surveillance equipment two hours before Sarah disappeared. Combined with his truck matching the description from the Crossroads, his uncomfortable relationship with Sarah, his suspicious reading materials, and the feeling Brandon couldn't shake about that barn—it was adding up.

But it still wasn't enough.

"Where to now?" Matt asked as they got back in the car.

Brandon checked his watch. Two-thirty. "Back to the motel. We need to compile everything we have and figure out our next move. Dunham said he'd have the original case files ready tomorrow. Maybe there's something in his notes we can use."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out where Kovacs placed those cameras. Because that's where the answer is."

They drove back toward Thorndale in silence. The rain had started again, light but persistent. Brandon watched the fields go by, thinking about trail cameras and barns and guilt.

About the difference between knowing something and proving it.

About Sarah Carpenter, who just wanted to go to college and study English and become a librarian. Who called her mom to say she'd be late. Who recognized someone she shouldn't have trusted.

Somewhere in Parke County, four trail cameras were watching something. Recording movement. Gathering evidence.

Brandon just had to figure out where.

And what they'd been watching during the past six months.

# Chapter Five
**Friday Morning**

Matt pulled onto County Road 275 just after nine AM, gravel crunching under the tires. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, quiet since they'd left the motel. He'd been like that all morning—present but distant, like his mind was already at the property they were about to visit.

Dale Kovacs's place sat a half-mile down the road, a white farmhouse with dark green shutters set back from the county road. The house looked well-maintained in that utilitarian way bachelor farmers kept things—paint wasn't peeling, gutters were clean, lawn was mowed. But there were hints of better days: flower boxes under the windows gone to weeds, a faded welcome mat, the remnants of what might have once been a garden bed along the porch. The kind of touches a woman might add that a man living alone would let slip.

Brandon's gaze went straight to the barn when they pulled in.

"You good?" Matt asked.

"Yes." Brandon's voice was flat. "Let's do this."

A dark blue Silverado sat in the driveway, ten to fifteen years old, well-used but clean. Matt parked behind it and they got out. The morning was cool and still, the sky overcast but not threatening rain. A crow called from somewhere in the trees behind the barn.

Matt walked to the truck and glanced at the back window. There—a small decal in the lower corner. He couldn't make out what it was from this angle, but it was there. Same spot Travis had mentioned.

The front door opened before they reached the porch. Dale Kovacs stepped out, wearing jeans and a flannel shirt, work boots, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead. Mid-forties, brown hair going gray at the temples, medium build. He looked tired but not hostile.

"Can I help you?" His tone was neutral, cautious but not unfriendly.

Matt showed his badge. "Agent Ellis, FBI. This is Agent Gray. We're investigating the disappearance of Sarah Carpenter. We'd like to ask you a few questions if you have a few minutes."

Dale's expression didn't change much—a slight tightening around the eyes, but he nodded. "Sure. I saw you boys at the library yesterday didn't I. I already talked to the deputies back in April, but I'm happy to help however I can." He came down off the porch. "You want to come inside, or...?"

"Out here is fine," Matt said. "We won't take much of your time. We're just gathering information from people who knew Sarah and had contact with her around the time she disappeared."

"All right." Dale folded his arms, not defensively but like he was cold. The sun was out today, but the morning was chilly and crisp. "What do you need to know?"

Matt pulled out his notebook. "We understand you are a regular patron at the Blackburn Public Library?"

"That's right. I like to read. Go there a few times a month."

"Did you know Sarah Carpenter?"

"Not really. I mean, I knew who she was. She worked the circulation desk. We'd talk a little when I checked out books. Small talk, nothing personal."

Brandon had moved slightly to the side, his eyes drifting past Dale toward the barn. Matt noticed Dale notice.

"What kind of books do you read, Mr. Kovacs?" Matt asked.

"History, mostly. True crime sometimes. Military history."

"You were at the library on April sixteenth?"

Dale hesitated, just a beat. "I might've been. I don't remember specific dates."

"We have borrowing records that show you checked out three books that afternoon. Around four-thirty."

Dale's jaw tightened slightly. "Okay. Then I was there."

"Did you see Sarah that day?"

"Probably. Like I said, she usually worked the desk."

"Did you talk to her?"

"Just whatever you say when someone checks out your books. 'Have a good day,' that kind of thing."

Brandon spoke for the first time, his voice quiet. "What did you do before you arrived the library?"

Dale looked at him. "Went to the Rural King. Needed some supplies."

"What kind of supplies?" Brandon asked.

"Trail cameras. I'd been having some trouble on my property. I wanted to see what was moving through."

Matt made a note. "What kind of trouble were you having?"

"Something was coming on my property, I'd seen...tracks. I wanted to find out what."

"How many cameras did you buy?"

"Four."

"Where did you place them?" Brandon asked. His gaze kept drifting toward the barn.

"Couple in front near the road, couple out back."

"Near the barn?" Brandon's eyes finally settled on Dale.

Dale's expression shifted—something flickered there. Wariness. "One of them was, yeah."

Matt kept his tone conversational. "What time did you leave the Rural King?"

"I don't know. Maybe six, six-fifteen."

"And what about after the library? What did you do then?"

"Came home. Set up the cameras. Had dinner."

"Did you go out again that evening?"

"No."

"You didn't stop anywhere after the library?"

Dale's arms tightened slightly. "No. I came straight here."

Matt flipped through his notes, letting the silence stretch. Brandon had turned fully toward the barn now, staring at it like he was reading something written on its walls.

"Mr. Kovacs," Matt said, "we have a witness who saw a Silverado at the Crossroads Mini-Mart the night Sarah disappeared. Around eight-fifteen PM."

Dale's face went carefully blank. "Lot of Silverados around here."

"A dark blue Silverado," Matt clarified. "With a decal on the back window."

Dale said nothing.

"Your truck is dark blue," Matt continued. "And it has a decal on the back window."

"Like I said. Lot of trucks like that."

Brandon turned back to face them. "Were you at the Crossroads that night?"

The question hung in the air. Dale looked between them—Matt's neutral expression, Brandon's intense focus.

"No," Dale said finally.

"Where were you at eight-fifteen?"

"Here. Like I told you."

"Can anyone verify that?"

"I live alone."

Matt made another note. "Mr. Kovacs, Sarah's borrowing records show you checked out books on the same days she was working at least thirteen times in the six months before she disappeared. That seems like more than coincidence."

"It's a small library. She worked most of the shifts."

"But you'd come in more frequently in those months than you had previously."

Dale's jaw worked. "I don't keep track of how often I go to the library."

"Did you have any kind of relationship with Sarah outside the library?"

"No."

"Did you ever ask her out? Try to spend time with her?"

"No."

Brandon spoke again, his voice very quiet. "But you wanted to."

Dale's eyes snapped to Brandon. "What?"

"You noticed her. You came in more often because you wanted to see her."

"I went to check out books."

"Thirteen times in six months," Brandon said. "Always when she was working. You knew her schedule."

Dale's hands flexed. "I didn't do anything wrong. Going to a library isn't a crime."

"No," Matt said. "But taking someone against their will is."

"I didn't take anyone anywhere."

"Then why does your truck match the witness description? Why were you buying surveillance equipment two hours before Sarah disappeared? Why—"

"I wasn't at the Crossroads." Dale's voice had risen slightly. Not shouting, but strained. "I was here. All night."

Brandon was staring at the barn again. Matt noticed Dale's eyes following his gaze, and something in his face changed. Fear, maybe. Or guilt.

"That barn trouble you, Mr. Kovacs?" Matt asked.

"What? No. It's just a barn."

"When's the last time you were in it?"

"I don't know. Few weeks ago maybe."

"Not more recently?"

Dale's breathing had quickened slightly. "What do you want from me?"

Matt kept his voice level. "We want to know what happened to Sarah Carpenter."

"I don't know what happened to her."

"I think you do" Brandon said. It wasn't a question.

Dale looked at Brandon for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was tight. "I think you should leave."

"Mr. Kovacs—"

"Do you have a warrant?"

"No," Matt said.

"Then I don't have to talk to you. And I want you off my property." Dale stepped back toward his porch. "If you want to come back, bring a warrant."

Matt held up a hand. "We're not trying to railroad you, Mr. Kovacs. We're just trying to find out what happened to a young woman who disappeared six months ago. If you know anything that could help—"

"She had trouble with her car. Said it wasn't starting right," Dale said suddenly. The words came out rushed, like they'd been pulled from him against his will. "The starter was bad. That's probably why she was at the Crossroads."

Matt went very still. "How do you know that?"

Dale's face had gone pale. "I-I think she mentioned it that day. That's usually why a car won't start, right?"

"The starter specifically," Brandon said. "You said the starter."

"I meant—I just meant—" Dale shook his head. "You need to leave. Now."

"Mr. Kovacs, if you know something about what happened to Sarah's car—"

"Get off my property." Dale's voice was shaking now. "I'm done talking."

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. They could push, but without a warrant they had no leverage. And Dale was clearly done cooperating.

"We'll be in touch," Matt said. He pulled a business card from his pocket and held it out. "If you think of anything else you want to tell us."

Dale didn't take the card. Matt set it on the porch railing.

They walked back to the car in silence. Matt glanced at the Silverado as they passed—the decal on the back window was a Browning logo, the deer head silhouette. Same kind of hunting decal you'd see on half the trucks in rural Indiana.

But Travis had seen one. On a dark blue Silverado. At the Crossroads.

Matt started the engine and pulled out of the driveway. In the rearview mirror, he could see Dale standing on his porch, watching them leave. His hands were shaking.

Neither of them spoke until they were back on Route 39, heading toward Thorndale.

"That detail about the starter," Matt said finally.

"Yeah." Brandon was staring out the window.

"No one ever even figured out her card had been tampered with."

"No."

"So either he tampered with her car himself, or—"

"Or he knows who did." Brandon turned to look at Matt. "He's scared. Not just of us. Of something else."

"You think he's protecting someone?"

"Maybe. Or he's afraid of being blamed for something he didn't do."

Matt thought about Dale's face when Brandon had stared at the barn. The fear there. The guilt.

"What did you pick up from him?" Matt asked.

Brandon was quiet for a moment. "He's not a predator. His interest in Sarah—it was real, but not aggressive. Not obsessive in the way you'd expect from someone who'd abduct her. He's got shame, yeah, but it's not the shame of someone who hurt her."

"Then what is it?"

"Failure, maybe. Like he tried to do something and it went wrong."

Matt processed this. "You think he took her? Not to hurt her, but—"

"I don't know what I think yet." Brandon rubbed his face. "But something happened in that barn. Something bad. And he knows about it."

They pulled into the sheriff's department parking lot fifteen minutes later. Dunham's cruiser was there, along with Kowalski's. Matt cut the engine.

"The starter detail is solid if we can confirm it," he said. "Combined with the truck description, the decal, the timeline—that's enough for a warrant."

"Yeah."

"But?"

Brandon looked at him. "But I don't think we're going to find Sarah. I think we're going to find answers. And I'm not sure they're the answers we expect."

They went inside. Dunham was at his desk, going through paperwork. He looked up when they entered.

"How'd it go with Kovacs?"

"He lawyered up," Matt said. "Not literally, but he kicked us off his property. Wouldn't consent to a search."

"Can't say I'm surprised." Dunham leaned back in his chair. "You get anything useful?"

"Enough for a warrant, I think." Matt pulled out his notebook. "Kovacs's truck matches the witness description—Travis remembered a dark blue Silverado with a decal on the back window. He was at the Rural King buying trail cameras to monitor his house and yard two hours before Sarah disappeared. And he just told us that Sarah's car wouldn't start because the starter was bad."

Dunham sat up straighter. "He said that?"

"Word for word. 'Her car wasn't starting right. The starter was bad.'"

"We knew the car wouldn't start because she called triple-A. We never took a close look at why," Dunham said slowly.

"I know."

"If it was tampered with, he's either the one who did it—"

"Or he knows who did," Brandon finished.

Dunham looked between them. "You think he's good for this?"

Matt hesitated. "I think there's enough to search his property. What we find there will tell us more."

"All right." Dunham pulled out his phone. "I'll call Judge Morrison. She's usually pretty quick on warrants if the evidence is solid. What are you asking for?"

"Full property search," Matt said. "House, barn, outbuildings, vehicles. We're also requesting copies of any trail camera footage from the past six months."

"She'll probably grant it. Might take a few hours to get the paperwork." Dunham started dialing. "What are you two going to do in the meantime?"

"You said you had the original case files ready?"

"Yeah, they're in the conference room. Everything we documented from the night Sarah disappeared through the end of May when we stopped active investigation."

"I'll go through those," Brandon said. "See if there's anything we missed."

Matt nodded. "I want to verify Kovacs's detail about the starter. Where's Sarah's car now?"

"Henderson's Towing and Storage, out on Highway 36. They've got a contract with the county for long-term storage of evidence vehicles. Sarah's car is still there—we never released it to the family since it's technically still evidence."

"Can you call ahead? Let them know I'm coming?"

"Sure thing." Dunham dialed another number.

Matt looked at Brandon. "You good here?"

"Yeah. Go."

Matt headed for the door, then paused. "Gray?"

Brandon looked up.

"If you see anything in those files—anything that doesn't fit—"

"I'll call you."

Matt nodded and left.

The drive to Henderson's took twenty minutes. The place sat on a flat stretch of highway, surrounded by chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. A trailer served as the office, and behind it Matt could see rows of vehicles in various states of disrepair—wrecks waiting for insurance claims, seized vehicles waiting for court dates, evidence waiting for trials that might never come.

A man in coveralls met him at the gate. "You the FBI agent Dunham called about?"

"That's right. Matt Ellis." He showed his badge.

"Carl Henderson. You're here about the Carpenter girl's car?"

"Yes sir."

Henderson unlocked the gate and led Matt through the yard. They passed a minivan with a caved-in driver's side, a motorcycle that looked like it had been dragged for a quarter mile, a pickup truck with its front end accordion-folded into the cab.

"Here she is." Henderson stopped in front of a red Honda Civic. License plate still attached, library bumper sticker still on the back. Dust covered the windows but otherwise it looked untouched, like Sarah had just parked it yesterday.

"Mind if I take a look?" Matt asked.

"Be my guest. Dunham said you might want to pop the hood."

"I would, yeah."

Henderson opened the driver's door and pulled the hood release. The hood lifted with a rusty squeal.

Matt leaned over the engine. He wasn't a mechanic, but he'd changed enough oil and replaced enough batteries to know the basics. The starter was visible near the bottom of the engine, connected to the flywheel.

He pulled out his phone and turned on the flashlight, angling it to get a better look.

There—on the electrical connection to the starter. The wire had been partially disconnected, just enough that it wouldn't make full contact. Not cut, not obviously damaged. Just loosened. Someone who knew what they were doing could do it in thirty seconds. And when Sarah turned the key, the engine would crank but not catch right away. The wire was still connected enough that it might catch eventually. Probably how she got it started at the library. But when she tried again at the Crossroads, nothing.

It wasn't an accident. It wasn't a mechanical failure.

Someone had sabotaged her car. Deliberately. Knowing she'd likely be stranded.

Matt took several photos, documenting the connection from multiple angles. Then he carefully reconnected the wire, making sure it was seated properly.

"You find what you needed?" Henderson asked.

"Yeah." Matt closed the hood. "Yeah, I did."

He stood there for a moment, looking at the car. Sarah's library badge still hung from the rearview mirror. A coffee cup in the cupholder. A book on the passenger seat—*The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood.

She'd been twenty-two years old. She'd wanted to study English. She'd called her mom to say she'd be late.

And someone had made sure her car wouldn't start that night.

Matt's phone rang. Dunham.

"Ellis."

"Judge Morrison signed the warrant. We're good to go for Kovacs's property. When can you be back?"

Matt checked his watch. Eleven-thirty. "Give me thirty minutes."

"I'll have lunch waiting," Dunham said. "We can decide when and how to serve this."

Matt ended the call and looked at the Honda one more time. Dale Kovacs had known about the starter. He'd known exactly what was wrong with Sarah's car.

Which meant either he'd sabotaged it himself, or he'd seen who did.

Matt got back in his car and headed toward Rockville. The whole drive, he kept thinking about Dale's face when Brandon had stared at the barn. That look of fear. Of guilt.

Of failure.

Brandon was right. They weren't going to find what they expected when they searched that property.

# Chapter Six
**Friday Afternoon**

Brandon sat in the conference room at the Parke County Sheriff's Department, waiting for Matt to return from Henderson's Towing. The original case files were spread across the table in front of him—witness statements, evidence logs, photos from the scene. He'd been through most of it in the hour Matt had been gone.

Deputy Kowalski's initial report was thorough. Times documented to the minute. Descriptions detailed. He'd canvassed the area around the Crossroads that night, knocked on doors at three nearby farmhouses, checked with Marv about customers who'd been in the store earlier that evening. Good police work.

Brandon stared at the photo of Sarah's purse on the ground by the payphone. Her keys were still in it. Wallet, lip balm, a library card with her photo, receipts from the grocery store and gas station. Everything you'd expect.

Everything except her cell phone.

The door opened. Matt came in, followed by Dunham. Both men looked grim.

"It was tampered with," Matt said without preamble. "The electrical connection to the starter was loosened. Not cut, not obviously damaged. Just disconnected enough that it would be intermittent. Sometimes it would catch, sometimes it wouldn't."

"That's how she got it started at the library but not at the Crossroads," Brandon said.

"Exactly." Matt sat down across from him. "Someone who knew what they were doing could do it in thirty seconds. And Dale Kovacs knew exactly what was wrong with that car."

Dunham leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. "Judge Morrison signed the warrant an hour ago. Full property search—house, barn, outbuildings, vehicles, and any trail camera footage. Question is when we serve it."

"Today or tomorrow?" Matt asked.

"Your call. I can have deputies ready either way."

Brandon looked at the case files spread in front of him. Six months Sarah had been missing. Six months Dale had been sitting on that property, knowing what had happened. Another twelve hours wouldn't change anything.

"Tomorrow morning," Matt said. "Saturday. Dale's more likely to be home, less likely to have advance warning if anyone sees us staging."

Dunham nodded. "I'll have my team here at oh-seven-hundred. We'll brief and roll out by oh-seven-thirty. That puts us at his property by eight."

"Who are you bringing?" Matt asked.

"Me along with Deputies Harris, Michaels, and Kowalski. Harris is good with documentation—he'll photograph and video everything. Kowalski was first on scene back in April, he knows the case. Michaels can keep Kovacs in check. Plus it's a Saturday—most of my deputies are off."

"We'll need to call in forensics if we find what we think we're going to find," Matt said.

"ISP has a crime scene unit in Terre Haute. I'll give them a call, make sure they're on standby for tomorrow." Dunham pushed off the doorframe. "You two should get some rest. Tomorrow's going to be a long day."

After Dunham left, Matt turned to Brandon. "You find anything useful in those files?"

"Kowalski did good work that night. Thorough. Documented everything."

"But?"

Brandon tapped the photo of Sarah's purse. "We talked about this the other night, but her cell phone wasn't in here. It was found at the library a week later, in the stacks. The implication being she must have left it there during her workday."

"So?"

"So she called AAA from the payphone at the Crossroads. She would've used her cell if she'd had it with her. That's what anyone would do. You don't go straight to a payphone in 2010 unless you don't have your phone."

Matt thought about this. "You think someone made sure she didn't have it?"

"I think it's convenient for our perp that she didn't have. No cell phone means no GPS tracking, no call records from that night except the landline at the Crossroads."

"You think that was planned?"

Brandon closed the file folder. "I think tomorrow we're going to find out what Dale was planning. And whether he was planning it alone."

---

**Saturday Morning**

The sun was just starting to burn off the morning mist when they pulled onto County Road 275. Two vehicles—Matt driving the FBI sedan with Brandon in the passenger seat, Dunham following in his cruiser with Deputies Harris and Kowalski.

Brandon had been quiet during the drive from Rockville. He'd eaten breakfast mechanically, barely tasting it. His mind was already at that barn, already feeling the weight of what they were about to find.

Dale's truck was in the driveway when they arrived. Lights were on in the house. He was awake.

They parked and got out. The morning was cool and still. Brandon could see the barn beyond the house, its red paint weathered to rust in places. The door was closed.

Dunham knocked on the front door. Matt stood beside him, warrant folder in hand. Brandon hung back slightly, watching. Harris had a camera ready. Kowalski stood to the left of the door, hand resting near his duty weapon.

The door opened. Dale looked at all of them, taking in the vehicles, the uniforms, the expressions. His face went pale.

"Mr. Kovacs," Dunham said. "We have a warrant to search your property."

Dale's eyes moved from Dunham to Matt to the deputies. When his gaze landed on Kowalski, something flickered across his face—recognition, yes, but also something else. Fear, maybe. Or anger. His jaw tightened and he took a half-step back.

Brandon watched this carefully. Dale had no reaction to Harris. But Kowalski made him flinch.

"Can I see it?" Dale's voice was hoarse, like he'd been expecting this but hoping it wouldn't come.

Matt handed him the warrant. Dale's hands shook slightly as he read it. He didn't read carefully—just scanned it, looking for the scope. House, barn, outbuildings, vehicles. Everything.

"I want to call my lawyer," Dale said quietly.

"You're not under arrest," Matt said. "But you're welcome to call anyone you want. We're going to execute this warrant now."

Dale stepped back from the door, pulling it open wider. "It's not what you think."

"What do we think, Mr. Kovacs?" Dunham asked.

Dale looked at all of them again. His eyes lingered on Kowalski. "Y'all think I hurt her. I didn't. I was trying to help."

"Help who?" Matt asked.

Dale's mouth worked but no sound came out. Finally he just shook his head. "I want my lawyer."

"That's your right," Dunham said. "You can wait in your living room or outside. Deputy Michaels will stay with you. The rest of us are going to search your property now."

Dunham looked at Matt, then at Brandon. "How do you want to split up?"

Brandon spoke before Matt could. "I'll take the barn."

Matt studied him for a moment, then nodded. "I'll start with the house. Dunham, you want to coordinate?"

Kowalski spoke up quickly, "I'll take the barn with Agent Gray."

"Ok. Harris, you're with Matt for documentation." Dunham turned to Dale. "Keys to the barn?"

"It's not locked."

"Any animals in there we should know about?"

"A couple of old barn cats. But they won't bother ya." Dale's voice was barely a whisper.

They separated. Brandon walked toward the barn with Kowalski beside him. The deputy was quiet, his expression professional but curious. Brandon could feel him watching.

The barn door wasn't locked, just as Dale had said. Brandon pulled it open. The hinges creaked. Light spilled into the interior, illuminating dust motes in the air.

The space was mostly empty. Some old equipment against the far wall—a rusted plow, milk cans, a workbench cluttered with tools. The floor was hard-packed dirt. Overhead, the loft was accessible by a ladder, but it looked undisturbed.

Brandon stood just inside the doorway, letting his eyes adjust. Letting himself feel.

The impression hit him immediately, the same one he'd felt two days ago. Trauma. Terror. Death. It saturated the space like a stain.

Brandon's eyes moved to the southeast corner of the barn, near where the workbench stood. The dirt there was slightly darker, slightly more disturbed.

He could almost see it—a woman on the ground, struggling. Hands at her throat. The desperate need to do something, anything, to leave evidence. To make sure someone would know she'd been here.

He walked toward it.

"What are you looking for?" Kowalski asked from behind him.

"Evidence," Brandon said simply.

He knelt by the dark patch of dirt. Up close, it was clear that something had happened here. The ground was compressed in a pattern that didn't match the rest of the floor. Something had happened in this area. And the ground had been soft when it had.

Brandon pulled a pair of latex gloves from his pocket and put them on. He produced a small flashlight to illuminate the ground and started combing the area gently with his fingers.

"You see something?" Kowalski moved closer.

"Maybe."

Brandon took out his switchblade and pushed the thumb slide. The blade punched forward and locked open. Using the knife, he began moving dirt carefully, methodically. Two inches down, he saw a glint of metal. He worked around it, exposing more of the object.

A bracelet. Silver, delicate, partially tarnished. It had been buried deliberately, pressed down into the soft earth.

Brandon pulled it free and held it up to the light. It was distinctive—a charm bracelet with several small pendants. A book. A musical note. A tiny heart with initials he couldn't quite make out.

She'd tried to leave evidence. Some victims did that—knowing they might not survive, they tried to make sure someone would know they'd been there. Brandon understood that impulse better than he wanted to.

"How did you know that was there?" Kowalski's voice had an edge to it now. Suspicion.

Brandon looked at him. Kowalski was staring at the bracelet. He wasn't surprised at the find. He was more concerned with the how.

"I didn't," Brandon said. "I was searching for evidence. I found some."

He stood, placing the bracelet carefully in an evidence bag he'd brought from the car. He sealed it, marked it with the date and location.

Kowalski was still watching him. "You just happened to dig in the exact right spot?"

"The dirt was disturbed here. It stood out."

It wasn't entirely a lie. The dirt was disturbed in that area.

He turned and walked back toward the barn door, the bagged bracelet in his hand. Behind him, he heard Kowalski's footsteps following.

As they emerged into the morning sunlight, Brandon glanced back at the barn. The impression was still there—fading now, but not gone. Something terrible had happened in that barn.

---

Brandon walked toward the house, the evidence bag in his hand. Through the front window, he could see Matt, Harris, and Dunham in what looked like a hallway, both of them staring at something. Matt was taking photos with his phone.

Dale sat on the front porch steps, Deputy Michaels standing a few feet away. Dale's head was in his hands. When Brandon walked past, Dale looked up. His eyes went to the evidence bag, then to Brandon's face.

"Where was it?" Dale's voice was barely audible.

Brandon didn't answer. He climbed the porch steps and went inside.

The house was neat but sparse. Living room with an old couch and a television. Kitchen visible through a doorway, clean dishes in the rack by the sink. The hallway led to what Brandon assumed were bedrooms.

Matt and Dunham stood outside a door at the end of the hall. The door had a deadbolt on the outside.

"Gray," Matt said when he saw him. "You need to see this."

Brandon walked down the hall. The door was open now. Inside was a small bedroom—maybe ten by twelve feet. A twin bed with the sheets pulled back. A nightstand with a lamp. A dresser.

But it was the details that told the story.

A chain bolted to the floor near the bed, long enough to reach the attached bathroom but not the door. Empty water bottles in a trash can. Granola bar wrappers. A paperback novel on the nightstand—*Jane Eyre*.

And on the dresser, a hair tie. Long blonde strands still caught in the elastic.

"Jesus," Brandon said quietly.

"There's more." Matt gestured to the bathroom. "Toothbrush in there. Women's shampoo. She was here for at least a few days."

Dunham was taking notes. "We'll need ISP forensics to confirm the hair is Sarah's, but this is enough to arrest him. This is a crime scene."

Brandon held up the evidence bag with the bracelet. "Found this in the barn. Buried in the dirt in the southeast corner."

Matt took the bag, studying the bracelet through the plastic. "Charm bracelet. That's specific enough that Sarah's mother could probably identify it."

"It was pushed into the ground," Brandon said. "Almost definitely deliberately buried."

Dunham looked at him sharply. "How do you know it was deliberate?"

"The way it was positioned, almost two inches deep. Someone pushed it down and covered it."

Matt was still examining the bracelet. "If this is Sarah's, and it was in the barn..." He looked at Brandon. "She was kept in the house but later moved to the barn?"

"That's what the evidence suggests."

"Why move her?" Dunham asked. "If he had her locked up here, why take her to the barn?"

Brandon looked back at the bedroom. The chain. The water bottles. The book. Someone had been kept here, but not violently. Not in squalor. The room was clean. There was food, water, reading material.

"He wasn't torturing her," Brandon said. "This looks like he wanted her to be comfortable. Safe."

"Safe from what?" Matt asked.

"Or from who," Brandon said quietly.

Dunham pulled out his phone. "I'm calling ISP. We need a full crime scene team here. This is beyond what we can process ourselves." He stepped into the hallway to make the call.

Matt moved closer to Brandon, lowering his voice. "You found that bracelet pretty fast. How?"

"The dirt was disturbed in that corner."

"You didn't have time to search the whole barn. You went right to that spot. The same spot you went to the other day."

Brandon met his eyes. "Sometimes you get lucky."

Matt held his gaze for a moment, then nodded slowly. He didn't believe it was luck, but he wasn't going to push. Not here. Not now.

Dunham came back into the room. "ISP is sending a team. They'll be here in ninety minutes. In the meantime, we secure the scene and arrest Kovacs."

"On what charge?" Matt asked.

"Kidnapping at minimum. We've got evidence someone was held here against their will and every reason to believe it was Sarah. Forensics will confirm it, but we can arrest him on what we have now." Dunham looked around the room one more time. "This changes things. Dale Kovacs has been sitting on this property for six months knowing Sarah Carpenter was here."

"But she's not here now," Brandon said. "And if she died in the barn, where's her body?"

The question hung in the air. Matt looked at Brandon, and Brandon saw the realization forming.

"He moved her," Matt said. "After she died, he moved her body."

"Someone did," Brandon said.

Dunham frowned. "You think there's another person involved?"

"I think there's quite a bit more to this than we know right now," Brandon said. "We need to ask Dale Kovacs some very specific questions."

They walked back outside. Dale was still sitting on the porch steps, his head in his hands. When he heard them coming, he looked up. His eyes were red.

Dunham stepped forward. "Dale Kovacs, you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Sarah Carpenter. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law..."

Dale didn't resist as Harris pulled him to his feet and cuffed him. He just stood there, looking at the house, then at the barn, then at nothing.

"I tried to protect her," he said quietly. "I tried."

"Protect her from what?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "Not without a lawyer."

"Where is she, Dale?" Brandon asked. His voice was very quiet. "Where's Sarah?"

Dale looked at him. For a moment, Brandon thought he might answer. But then Dale's expression closed, and he looked away.

"I need my lawyer," he said again.

Harris led Dale to the cruiser and placed him in the back seat. Dunham turned to Matt and Brandon.

"I'll process him at the station. You two stay here until ISP arrives. Make sure no one contaminates the scene." He paused. "Good work. Both of you. We've got him."

But as Dunham drove away with Dale in custody, Brandon stood looking at the barn. They had Dale, yes. They had evidence. They had a crime scene.

But they didn't have Sarah.

And Brandon had a feeling that when they found out what really happened in that barn, everything they thought they knew about this case was going to fall apart.

---

Kowalski had been standing near his own vehicle during the arrest, watching but not participating. Now he walked over to where Brandon stood.

"Hell of a find in that barn," Kowalski said. His tone was conversational, but his eyes were sharp. "How'd you know where to dig?"

Brandon looked at him. "The dirt was disturbed."

"Right. The dirt." Kowalski's smile didn't reach his eyes. "You FBI guys must have good training."

"We do our job."

"That you do." Kowalski glanced at the barn, then back at Brandon. "You think he killed her in there? Sarah?"

"The bracelet suggests she was there."

"But no body."

"Not yet."

Kowalski nodded slowly. "Well, I hope you find her. Sarah deserves better than this. Her family deserves answers." He turned to leave, then paused. "You know, I was first on scene the night she disappeared. Talked to Travis Walton right after he called it in. I've been thinking about this case for six months."

"I'm sure you have," Brandon said.

"Yeah." Kowalski's expression was unreadable. "I'm sure we all have."

He walked back to his vehicle to wait for the ISP team.

Matt came up beside him. "ISP will be here soon. We should document what we can before they take over."

"Yeah."

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. "I think Dale was telling the truth. He was trying to protect her."

"From what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon turned back toward the barn. "But whoever he was protecting her from—that's who killed her."

Matt followed his gaze. "And that person is still out there."

"Yes," Brandon said quietly. "They are."

# Chapter Seven
**Saturday Afternoon**

Matt stood in the observation room, watching Dale Kovacs through the one-way glass. Dale sat at a metal table in Interview Room One, hands folded in front of him, still wearing the same flannel shirt and jeans from this morning. He hadn't said a word since arriving at the station two hours ago. Just sat there, staring at the table, waiting for his lawyer.

Brandon stood beside Matt, silent. He'd been like that since they'd left Dale's property—present but distant, processing everything they'd found.

The ISP crime scene unit had arrived right on schedule. They'd taken over the house and barn, photographing everything, collecting samples, documenting the scene with the kind of methodical precision that took hours. Matt and Brandon had given their statements about what they'd found, turned over the bracelet, and left them to their work.

Now came the hard part.

"You think he'll talk?" Matt asked.

Brandon's eyes never left Dale. "He wants to. He's been carrying this for six months."

"But?"

"But he's scared. And he should be."

The door to the interview room opened. A man in his late fifties walked in, carrying a worn leather briefcase. Salt-and-pepper hair, rumpled gray suit, wire-rimmed glasses. He had the look of a small-town attorney who'd been practicing in Parke County for thirty years—competent, cautious, and probably handling everything from wills to DUIs to the occasional criminal defense.

Dale looked up when the lawyer entered. Relief washed over his face.

"That's Gerald Hicks," Brandon said. "Local attorney. Does a little bit of everything. He's not a criminal defense specialist, but he's competent."

"You looked him up?"

"While we were waiting for ISP. Wanted to know who we'd be dealing with."

Matt watched as Hicks sat down next to Dale and opened his briefcase. They spoke in low tones, Hicks asking questions, Dale answering with short nods or shakes of his head. After about five minutes, Hicks closed his briefcase and looked directly at the mirror.

"That's our cue," Matt said.

They walked down the hall and entered the interview room. Matt carried a folder with Dale's arrest report, photos from the scene, and the preliminary notes from ISP. Brandon carried nothing but his notebook and a pen.

Dale looked up when they entered. His eyes were red-rimmed but focused. Hicks straightened in his chair, projecting professional competence.

"Agents," Hicks said, nodding. "Gerald Hicks, representing Mr. Kovacs. I understand you're here to discuss the charges against my client."

Matt sat down across from Dale and Brandon took the chair beside him. Matt placed the folder on the table but didn't open it.

"Mr. Kovacs has been arrested for kidnapping," Matt said. "We found evidence at his property that Sarah Carpenter was held there against her will. We also found what appears to be her bracelet buried in his barn. We have questions."

"My client is willing to cooperate," Hicks said carefully. "But I need to make something clear. Mr. Kovacs did not harm Sarah Carpenter. He did not kill her. What he did, he did with the intention of protecting her."

Matt kept his expression neutral. "Protecting her from what?"

Hicks looked at Dale, who nodded slightly.

"From someone who wanted to hurt her," Hicks said.

"Who?"

Dale's jaw tightened. He looked at his lawyer, then at Matt. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse. "I can't say. Not yet."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Can't or won't?"

"Can't." Dale's hands flexed on the table. "Not until I know it's safe."

Matt opened the folder and pulled out a photo of Sarah. "Then tell us what you can. Start from the beginning."

Dale stared at the photo for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was quiet. "About a year ago—late October or early November—I started noticing signs that someone had been on my property. In my barn, specifically. Little things. Tools moved. An old blanket I kept in the loft pulled down. Footprints in the dust that weren't mine."

"Did you report this to the sheriff?" Matt asked.

"No. At first I thought maybe I was imagining it. But it kept happening. Always when I was away from the property or asleep. Whoever it was, they knew when I wouldn't be there."

"What made you think it was a person and not an animal?"

"The way things were disturbed. Deliberate. Like someone was... visiting." Dale's jaw tightened. "I had a suspicion who it might be, but I couldn't be sure."

"So you bought the trail cameras," Brandon said.

"Not at first. It was harmless, and it stopped when winter set in."

"When did you get worried?" asked Matt.

"When the spring thaw came, it started happening more often. It got to a point that I needed to know if I was right."

"So you went to Rural King and bought the cameras," Matt stated looking up from his notebook.

Dale nodded. "April sixteenth. I went to the Rural King after work, bought four cameras. Planned to set them up the next morning to see if I could catch whoever was coming around."

Matt made a note. "Why wait until morning?"

"It was already getting dark when I got home. And I wanted to place them carefully—figure out the best angles. I wasn't in a rush." Dale's voice dropped. "Maybe I should have been."

"What happened the next morning?"

"I woke up early. Around six-thirty. Grabbed the cameras and headed out to the barn to start setting them up." Dale's hands were shaking now. "That's when I found her."

The room went quiet. Matt could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, the distant sound of phones ringing in the main office.

"Sarah," Matt said.

Dale nodded. "She was in the southeast corner of the barn. Chained to one of the support posts. On a makeshift bed made from blankets, soft ones...not the type I keep in the barn. She was unconscious. I thought she was dead at first, but then I saw her breathing."

"What did you do?"

"I checked for a pulse. She was alive but unresponsive. Her pupils were dilated—I thought maybe she'd been drugged." Dale wiped his face. "I got the chain off her—used a crowbar to break the padlock—and carried her to the house."

"You didn't call 911," Brandon said. Not a question.

"No. I—" Dale stopped, searching for words. "I knew who had done this. And I knew if I called the police, he'd find out. He'd come back."

"Who would come back?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "I can't say. Not here."

"Mr. Kovacs, if you know who took Sarah—"

"I said I can't." Dale's voice rose slightly, then he forced himself to calm down. "I need you to understand. The person who did this—if I say their name, they'll know I talked. And I can't... I can't put myself at risk like that. Not yet."

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. Saw that Brandon had also recognized the fear in Dale's voice.

"All right," Matt said carefully. "Tell us what happened after you brought her inside."

Dale took a shaky breath. "I put her in the spare bedroom. Called someone I know, a nurse. I knew she wouldn't ask questions. She came, examined her. Said she'd most likely been drugged with something strong, probably a benzodiazepine. She told me to keep her comfortable, said she'd come around in a few hours."

"Did the nurse report this?"

"No. I asked her not to. She's...an old friend." Dale's voice was tight with shame. "I told myself I was protecting Sarah. That I needed time to figure out what to do. I didn't think anyone would believe I just found her there."

"How long was she there?" Brandon asked.

"Three days." Dale's hands clenched. "She woke up the second day. She was terrified. Didn't remember much about what happened at the Crossroads—just fragments. The drugs had messed with her memory. She thought I was the one who'd taken her."

"Did you try to explain?"

"I did. But how do you explain something like that? 'I found you chained in my barn, so I brought you to my house and locked you in a bedroom'?" Dale's voice cracked. "She didn't believe me. She kept asking me to let her go, to call her mother. I told her I would, that I just needed to keep her safe a little longer."

Matt made notes, his mind working through the timeline. "What happened on the third day?"

Dale's face went pale. "I had a job. County maintenance work in Rockville. I'd already missed two days—if I didn't show up, I'd lose the contract. I thought she'd be safe. I'd set up the cameras by then, had them running. I figured if anyone came near the property, I'd know."

"But someone did come," Brandon said quietly.

"I checked the cameras when I got home around six-thirty. Someone had been there around two PM." Dale's voice shook. "The camera facing the house caught a vehicle pulling onto the property. Couldn't see details—too far away, wrong angle. But whoever it was went straight to the house. Broke the lock on the bedroom door and took her."

"Took her where?"

"The barn. The camera facing that direction caught them—just shapes, movement. I could see he was dragging her. She was fighting though, fully conscious. But he was bigger, stronger." Dale stopped, his breathing shallow. "They went inside the barn. The camera didn't show the interior. But I listened to the audio later. I heard her screaming. Then nothing."

Matt felt his chest tighten. "You got home after she was already dead."

Dale nodded, tears streaming down his face now. "I ran to the barn as soon as I saw the bedroom chain broken. She was in the southeast corner. He'd strangled her. There was dirt under her fingernails where she'd tried to claw at the ground. To leave evidence, maybe. To let someone know she'd been there."

Brandon's voice was barely audible. "The bracelet."

"It was still on her wrist when I found her. But it was loose—like she'd been trying to get it off, to leave it behind." Dale wiped his eyes. "I pulled it free and buried it where she'd been clawing. Kinda felt like I was carrying out her last wish by doing it."

"What did you do with her body?" Matt asked.

Dale was silent for a long moment. "I buried her. In the back pasture, under the oak tree near the property line. I know I should have called the police. But I was terrified. If they found her on my property, in my barn, after I'd kept her in my house—" His voice broke. "They'd never believe I was trying to protect her. And the person who killed her would walk free."

"Where's the trail camera footage now?"

"I deleted it. After I buried her." Dale looked at Matt directly. "I pulled the SD cards and destroyed them. I couldn't risk anyone finding them."

Matt leaned back in his chair. "Let me see if I understand this correctly. Someone you knew took Sarah from the Crossroads, drugged her, and left her in your barn. You found her, brought her into your house. Three days later, this same person came back, took her to the barn, and killed her. You buried her body and destroyed the evidence. And now you're refusing to tell us who this person is because you're afraid."

"Yes."

"Mr. Kovacs, withholding information in a murder investigation—"

"Is a crime. I know." Dale's jaw set. "But so is being an accessory. And that's what I'd be if I say anything more right now."

Hicks cleared his throat. "My client is willing to continue cooperating, but he has legitimate concerns about his safety. Perhaps if we could arrange for him to be held somewhere other than the county jail—"

"He's afraid of someone in local law enforcement," Brandon said. It wasn't a question.

The room went silent. Dale didn't confirm it, but he didn't deny it either.

Matt closed the folder. "We'll need to recover Sarah's body. You'll have to show us where you buried her."

"I will. Tomorrow. In daylight." Dale looked between them. "But I need your word that you'll keep me safe. That you won't let certain people know what I've told you."

"Who specifically?" Matt asked.

Dale shook his head. "Anyone who was involved in the original investigation. Anyone who had access to the files, the evidence, the witness statements."

Matt thought about that. The original investigation had been handled by Dunham and Kowalski. But a rural sheriff's office isn't compartmentalized. Every deputy in the station has full access to everything on this case. If Dale was afraid of someone in law enforcement, someone who knew where he lived, someone who could recognize his truck from security footage—

"We'll keep you in protective custody," Matt said. "Federal holding, not county. And we'll limit who knows the details of your statement."

Dale nodded slowly. "Thank you."

"But Mr. Kovacs," Matt leaned forward, his voice firm. "Eventually, you're going to have to tell us who killed Sarah Carpenter. Because right now, you're our only suspect. And you've already admitted to holding someone against their will and disposing of their body. It wouldn't be a leap to convince a jury you're guilty of the murder too. If you want that to change, you need to help us find the real killer."

"I know." Dale's voice was barely a whisper. "I just need time. Need to know it's safe."

Hicks gathered his papers. "I think that's enough for today. My client has cooperated extensively. He's told you where to find the victim's remains. He's explained his actions, however misguided they may have been. Pushing him further right now isn't going to help anyone."

Matt stood. "We'll arrange transport to a federal facility. You'll be there tonight."

After they left the interview room, Matt and Brandon walked back to the observation room. Through the glass, they could see Dale sitting with his head in his hands, Hicks speaking to him quietly.

"He knows exactly who killed her," Brandon said.

"Yeah."

"Someone in law enforcement. Someone who had access to the investigation. Someone who knew Dale's property well enough to use that barn."

"Someone who recognized Dale's truck in the security footage and figured out where Sarah was."

They stood in silence for a moment, both of them thinking through the implications.

"Kowalski was first on scene," Matt said quietly. "He ran the initial investigation with Dunham. He had access to everything."

"And he was in the barn with me this morning," Brandon added. "Watching me find that bracelet. Asking how I knew where to dig."

"But Dale's been afraid of this person for six months. If it's Kowalski, why didn't he just leave town? Why stay here where they could run into each other?"

"Maybe he couldn't leave. The property, his job—everything he has is here." Brandon turned away from the glass. "Or maybe he's been watching. Making sure the person who killed Sarah doesn't hurt anyone else."

Matt pulled out his phone. "I'm calling the bureau field office in Indianapolis. We need to get Dale out of this building and into protective custody before anyone knows what he told us."

"And then?"

"Then we figure out who else had access to that barn. Who knew Dale well enough to know that's where he'd keep someone. Who Sarah would have known from when she was younger." Matt started dialing. "Because Dale's story has holes in it. Things he's not telling us. And the only way we're going to find the truth is to dig into Dale's past."

Brandon looked back through the glass at Dale. "He's protecting someone. Even now."

"I know."

"Which means it's someone he cares about. Someone he has history with."

Matt held the phone to his ear, waiting for an answer on the other end. "Family, maybe. Or close to it."

Brandon didn't respond, but Matt saw the slight nod. They were both thinking the same thing.

Whoever killed Sarah Carpenter wasn't a stranger to Dale Kovacs.

They were someone he knew.

Someone he'd maybe even loved.

# Chapter Eight
**Sunday Morning**

Brandon stood at the edge of Dale Kovacs's back pasture, watching the forensics team work. The oak tree rose from the fence line like a sentinel—massive trunk, gnarled branches, the kind of tree that had been there for a century and would be there for another if someone didn't cut it down.

Beneath it, the ISP crime scene unit had marked off a grid with stakes and string. A ground-penetrating radar unit sat nearby, its operator having already confirmed what Dale had told them: there was a disruption in the soil consistent with a burial approximately six feet down, roughly five feet from the tree's trunk on the eastern side.

The sun had been up for maybe an hour. The morning air was cold enough that Brandon could see his breath. Matt stood twenty yards away with Chief Deputy Dunham, both of them watching the excavation begin. Dale was still in federal custody in Indianapolis—they'd transported him last night and he'd be there until they figured out who he was afraid of.

Brandon's phone buzzed. A text from Matt: *Dunham wants to know if you need to be here for this.*

Brandon typed back: *No. Would rather start on background.*

Matt looked up from his phone, caught Brandon's eye, and nodded. He said something to Dunham, then walked over.

"Dunham's going to supervise the recovery," Matt said. "ISP has it under control. He said we can use the conference room at the station to work."

"Good." Brandon turned away from the excavation. He didn't need to watch them dig up Sarah Carpenter's body. He'd already felt what happened to her in that barn. Watching them pull her remains from the ground wouldn't tell him anything he didn't already know.

They walked back to where they'd parked near Dale's house. The property looked different in daylight with no one living there—abandoned, waiting. Yellow crime scene tape still cordoned off the barn and the house. A single sheriff's cruiser sat in the driveway, Deputy Harris inside doing a security check.

Matt drove them back to Rockville. Neither spoke for the first few minutes. Brandon stared out the window at the farmland rolling past, his mind already working through what they needed to find.

"Dale's protecting someone he has history with," Matt said finally. "Someone who knew that barn well enough to use it. Someone who could visit the property without Dale immediately suspecting."

"Family," Brandon said. "Or close to it."

"So we start with Dale's family. See who's connected to him. Who would have spent time on that property."

Brandon pulled out his notebook. "Marriage records. Divorce records. Property history. We need to know everyone who's lived at that address in the last twenty years."

They reached the sheriff's station at eight-fifteen. The Sunday morning shift was minimal—just a dispatcher and Deputy Michaels doing paperwork in the bullpen. Dunham had called ahead; the conference room was unlocked and waiting for them.

Brandon set up his laptop on the table and connected to the mobile hotspot on his phone. Matt pulled out a legal pad and started making a list of what they needed.

"County clerk's office is closed Sundays," Matt said. "But we can access marriage and divorce records online through the state database if we have the right credentials."

"I'll call the Indianapolis field office," Brandon said. "Get us access."

While Brandon made the call, Matt pulled up the Parke County property records on his phone. Dale Kovacs had owned the property on County Road 275 since 1994—purchased June 1994. Before that, the property had been owned by someone named Eugene Kovacs, likely Dale's father.

Brandon ended his call. "Indianapolis is setting us up with access. Should have it in thirty minutes."

"Dale bought the property in '94," Matt said. "He'd be what, twenty-nine years old then?"

"Sounds right."

"Young to buy a farm. Wonder if it was a family thing—inheritance, parents selling to him cheap."

Brandon made a note. "We should find out if Dale has siblings. If so, where they are now."

Matt's phone rang. He glanced at the screen. "It's Dunham." He answered, putting it on speaker. "Ellis."

"We've got her," Dunham's voice came through, flat and professional. "ISP confirmed it's human remains, approximately the right time frame. They're transporting to the state lab in Terre Haute for identification and autopsy. Preliminary observation suggests cause of death consistent with strangulation."

"How long until we get a formal ID?" Matt asked.

"Dental records, probably twenty-four to forty-eight hours. But it's her. Everything matches—location, condition, clothing, timeframe."

Brandon felt that familiar heaviness settle in his chest. Sarah Carpenter, twenty-two years old, who wanted to study English and become a librarian. Who called her mother to say she'd be late. Who died trying to leave evidence so someone would know what happened to her.

"Thanks for the update," Matt said.

"I'm heading back to the station now. You boys find anything yet?"

"Working on it. We'll keep you posted."

After Dunham hung up, Matt set his phone down. "At least her mother will have closure. Eventually."

Brandon didn't respond. Anyone who'd lost someone violently knew closure was a myth. Closure was what people said when they didn't know what else to offer. Linda Carpenter would get her daughter's body back, but she'd never get Sarah back. That wasn't closure. That was just the end of waiting.

His mind flashed to Ashford, Missouri. To a payphone. Where the waiting had never ended.

His laptop chimed. The email from Indianapolis with database access credentials.

Brandon logged into the Indiana vital records system and pulled up Parke County marriage licenses. He typed in "Dale Kovacs" and hit search.

One result. Dale Richard Kovacs married to Jennifer Anne Harding, March 12, 1994.

"He was married," Brandon said.

Matt moved to look over his shoulder. "March '94. Three months before he bought the property."

Brandon clicked through to the divorce records database. Dale Richard Kovacs and Jennifer Anne Harding, divorced December 8, 2003.

"Divorced in 2003," Brandon said. "They were married nine years."

"Any kids listed?"

Brandon scanned the divorce decree. "No biological children mentioned. But—" He stopped, reading closer. "There's a notation about custody arrangements for a minor child, but it's listed as 'stepchild.' No name given in this document."

"So Jennifer had a kid from a previous relationship," Matt said. "That kid would have lived on Dale's property during the marriage."

"From 1994 to 2003," Brandon confirmed. "Nine years. Long enough to know that barn inside and out."

Matt pulled out his phone. "I'll see if I can find Jennifer Harding on social media. Maybe she remarried, changed her name."

While Matt searched, Brandon pulled up property tax records. The Kovacs property showed two residents from 1994 to 2003: Dale R. Kovacs and Jennifer A. Kovacs. After 2003, just Dale.

"Found her," Matt said. "Jennifer Harding-Powell. Lives in Bloomington now. Looks like she remarried in 2005. She's got a Facebook page, pretty active. Lots of photos."

"Of a son?"

"Multiple kids actually. Looks like she had at least two sons." Matt was scrolling through photos. "Here's an older photo from 2008. Jennifer with a younger son at his high school graduation. Caption says 'So proud of my Tyler graduating from Bloomington High South.' And then there are older photos—wait, here. From 1997. Jennifer and Dale with two boys. The younger one looks maybe seven or eight. The older one's a teenager."

Brandon moved to look at Matt's phone. The photo was faded-a scan of an old physical photo. It showed Jennifer and Dale standing with two boys in front of what looked like Dale's barn. The younger boy—Tyler, presumably—smiled at the camera. The older boy, maybe fifteen or sixteen, stood slightly apart, arms crossed, not quite looking at the camera.

"Two stepsons," Brandon said. "The younger one stayed with Jennifer after the divorce. What about the older one?"

"No recent photos of him that I can find. Last one I see is from 2001—him in what looks like a church youth group photo. He'd be maybe eighteen or nineteen there."

"So he was already an adult when the divorce happened," Matt said. "Or close to it. Old enough to leave on his own."

Brandon pulled up a new search window. "We need to find out who Jennifer was married to before Dale. The biological father of these kids."

"Start with obituaries," Matt suggested. "If he's dead, that would explain why Jennifer was a single mother when she married Dale."

Brandon typed "Jennifer Harding" plus "husband" plus "obituary" plus "Indiana."

Several results came up. He clicked on one from 1992: *Robert James Harding, 34, of Blackburn, Indiana, passed away after a brief battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife Jennifer and sons Marcus, 10, and Tyler, 2.*

Marcus.

"Marcus Harding," Brandon said. "Ten years old in 1992. That would make him twenty-nine now."

Matt leaned over to read the screen. "Father died when he was ten. Two years later, his mother marries Dale. He goes from losing his father to having a stepfather, moving to a new property."

"Formative years," Brandon said quietly. "That barn could have been his space. His refuge, maybe."

"And then the marriage falls apart when he's twenty-one. He's an adult by then, but that property—that barn specifically—would still feel like his."

Brandon opened a new search tab. "Marcus Harding" plus "Indiana."

Dozens of results. Common name. Too many to narrow down without more information.

"We need more specifics," Brandon said. "Where did he go after the divorce? What's he doing now?"

"Military records, college enrollment, employment history," Matt said. "Or we could just call Jennifer and ask."

Brandon shook his head. "If Marcus is our guy and he's still in contact with his mother, that would tip him off that we're looking at him."

"Fair point." Matt thought for a moment. "What about church records? You saw that photo from 2001—he was in a youth group. If he was active in church as a teenager, there might be records of where he went, what he did."

"Which church?"

"Thorndale only has two. We could check both."

Brandon checked his watch. Nine-thirty on a Sunday morning. Churches would be in service now. "We'd have to wait until afternoon to get into their offices."

"Or we could talk to people after service," Matt said. "See if anyone remembers Marcus Harding from the youth group ten or twelve years ago."

Brandon didn't like that approach. Too visible, too many people who might mention it to the wrong person. But they needed information, and they needed it quickly.

"Let's do general victim background first," Brandon said. "Talk to Sarah's mother. See what we can learn about Sarah's life, her connections. If Marcus knew her, there might be some overlap we can find."

Matt nodded. "Linda Carpenter. She lives in Thorndale. We should tell her about finding Sarah anyway."

They drove to Thorndale in silence. The town was quiet—a few cars parked outside the church on Main Street, some early morning walkers, not much else. Linda Carpenter lived on Oak Street, a modest ranch house with faded blue siding and white trim. The lawn was neat, flower beds mulched for winter. A car sat in the driveway—an older Nissan sedan, well-maintained.

Matt knocked on the door. They waited.

The woman who answered was in her late forties, dark blonde hair going gray at the temples, blue eyes like Sarah's. She wore jeans and a Purdue sweatshirt. When she saw their badges, something in her face changed—hope and dread mixed together.

"Mrs. Carpenter?" Matt said gently. "I'm Special Agent Ellis, this is Special Agent Gray. We're with the FBI. May we come in?"

Linda's hand went to her throat. "You found her."

It wasn't a question.

"Yes ma'am," Matt said. "We found Sarah's remains. I'm very sorry for your loss."

Linda didn't cry. She just nodded slowly, like she'd been expecting this for six months and was relieved to finally know. "Come in."

The living room was small and tidy. Photos covered every surface—Sarah as a baby, as a child, at her high school graduation, at the library. A shrine to a daughter who'd never come home.

They sat on the couch. Linda took the armchair across from them, her hands folded in her lap.

"Where was she?" Linda asked. Her voice was steady, controlled.

"On a property south of town," Matt said. "We've arrested someone in connection with her death. We're working to identify everyone involved."

"Who?"

"I can't say yet. The investigation is ongoing."

Linda's jaw tightened, but she nodded. "What do you need from me?"

Brandon pulled out his notebook. "We're trying to build a complete picture of Sarah's life. Who she knew, where she spent time, what was important to her. Sometimes connections that don't seem relevant turn out to matter."

"Where should I start?"

"Tell us about Sarah growing up," Matt said. "What was she like as a child?"

Linda's expression softened. "She was sweet. Quiet. Always reading. Her father used to joke that she'd read the phone book if we didn't keep her supplied with library books." Her voice caught on "father."

"Your husband passed away?" Brandon asked gently.

"Eleven years ago. Heart attack. Completely unexpected. He was only forty-two." Linda wiped her eyes. "Sarah was eleven. She took it very hard. They were close—he was the one who got her interested in books, who'd take her to the library every week."

Brandon made a note. Sarah's father had died when she was eleven. A traumatic loss at a formative age.

"How did Sarah cope?" Matt asked.

"Not well at first. She withdrew for a while. Stopped spending time with friends, just wanted to stay in her room and read. I took her to a counselor, but she wouldn't talk much. Said she was fine, but I knew she wasn't." Linda's hands twisted in her lap. "Then after about six months, she seemed to come out of it a little. Started going back to church youth group, reconnected with some friends."

"Did anyone help her through that time?" Brandon asked. "A friend, a mentor, someone at church?"

Linda thought for a moment. "The youth pastor at the time—Pastor Jim—he was good with the kids. He'd check in on Sarah, make sure she was doing okay. And there were some older kids in the youth group who were kind to her. I remember thinking how nice it was that the teenagers were looking out for the younger kids."

"Do you remember any of those teenagers specifically?"

"Not really. There were so many over the years." Linda paused. "Wait—there was one boy. I never knew his name, but Sarah mentioned once that he'd been talking to her a lot at youth group. Asking about her dad, how she was handling it. I thought it was sweet at first."

"At first?" Matt prompted.

"Sarah came to me about six months later—she would have been twelve by then—and said the boy made her uncomfortable. That he was always watching her, always trying to sit next to her, always asking personal questions. She asked if she could skip youth group for a while."

Brandon kept his voice level. "What did you do?"

"I talked to Pastor Jim about it. Told him Sarah felt uncomfortable with one of the older boys but didn't want to name names. He said he'd keep an eye on things, make sure everyone felt safe." Linda's face clouded. "Sarah went back a few weeks later. She never mentioned the boy again, so I assumed Pastor Jim had handled it."

"Do you know if the boy left the youth group?" Brandon asked.

"I don't know. I didn't follow up as closely as I should have. Sarah seemed okay, and I was dealing with my own grief, trying to keep us afloat financially. I wish—" Her voice broke. "I wish I'd paid more attention."

"Mrs. Carpenter, you did what you could," Matt said gently. "You had no way of knowing."

Brandon pulled out his phone and opened the Facebook photo Matt had found earlier—the 2001 youth group photo with the teenage Marcus Harding. He showed it to Linda.

"Does anyone in this photo look familiar?"

Linda took the phone and squinted at the screen. "That's from Thorndale Community Church. I recognize some of these kids—they're older now, but I can see it. That's the Miller boy, and that's one of the Johnson girls..." Her finger moved across the screen, then stopped. "Him. I think that might have been the boy. The one who made Sarah uncomfortable."

She was pointing at Marcus Harding.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his chest. "Are you certain?"

"Not certain, no. She never told me his name. But that face—there's something familiar about it. And the age is right. He looks about seventeen or eighteen in this photo, which would match the timing."

"Have you heard the name Marcus Harding before?" Brandon asked.

"Harding..." Linda's eyes widened slightly. "Jennifer Harding. I knew a Jennifer Harding years ago. We'd both been widowed young. We talked a few times at church, about losing our husbands, raising kids alone. She had two boys-one around Sarah's age and one older, but I can't remember their names."

"Did Sarah and Jennifer's son know each other?"

"I don't think so. Well, not as friends. They were in the same church, so they probably knew of each other."

Unless the age difference was exactly what attracted Marcus to Sarah. An older teenager, grieving his father, finding a younger girl who was going through the same loss. A connection that felt special. That turned into something darker.

"Mrs. Carpenter," Brandon said carefully, "do you know what happened to Jennifer Harding? Where she is now?"

"She remarried and moved away. I disremember where. That was several years ago, maybe 2005. I haven't kept in touch."

"And her sons?"

"The younger one moved with her. I have no idea about the older boy. He would have been an adult by then and may have alredy been gone."

Matt pulled up the Parke County Sheriff's Office website on his phone. The staff directory page showed three deputies in the right age range:

Deputy Jason Snider, 28
Deputy Miles Kowalski, 29  
Deputy Aaron Bowden, 27

He showed Linda the page. "Have you seen any of these men before?"

Linda looked at each photo carefully. When she got to Miles Kowalski, she paused.

"Him," she said, pointing. "I think I've seen him at the library. He came in a few times earlier this year. Sarah mentioned him once—said he'd asked her about her job, how long she'd worked there, that kind of thing. She thought maybe he was just being friendly."

"Did Sarah seem uncomfortable around him?" Brandon asked.

"Not that she mentioned. But she wouldn't have necessarily told me. Sarah didn't like to worry me."

Matt made a note. "Do you know if Deputy Kowalski knew Sarah from before? From when she was younger?"

"I don't know. I don't remember seeing him back then, but like I said, there were a lot of kids in town that I didn't know well."

Brandon studied the photo of Miles Kowalski on the sheriff's department website. Clean-cut, professional, the kind of face that blended into the background. Nothing remarkable. Nothing threatening.

But the age was right. Twenty-nine in 2011, which meant he was born around 1982. Close enough to the Marcus Harding timeline.

And he'd been asking Sarah about her job. About how long she'd worked there. 

Gathering information. Planning.

"Mrs. Carpenter," Matt said, "when Deputy Kowalski came into the library, did he check out books?"

"I don't know. You'd have to ask Patricia at the library."

Brandon made a note. They'd need to check the library records, see if Miles Kowalski had been a patron. See what kinds of books he was interested in.

"One last question," Brandon said. "Do you know anyone who works in law enforcement? Any family friends, neighbors, anyone Sarah would have trusted?"

Linda shook her head. "Not really. We're pretty quiet. Keep to ourselves. Why?"

"Just being thorough," Matt said.

They stood to leave. Linda walked them to the door, her arms wrapped around herself like she was cold.

"When can I..." she started, then stopped. "When can I bring her home?"

"The state lab needs to complete their examination," Matt said. "But soon. I promise."

Linda nodded. "Thank you. For finding her. For not giving up."

Outside, Matt and Brandon walked to the car in silence. Once they were inside, Matt turned to Brandon.

"So we've got Marcus Harding, age twenty-nine, who lost his father at age ten. Became Dale's stepson at twelve, lived on the property for at least seven years. Was in the same church youth group as Sarah, made her uncomfortable when she was twelve and he was eighteen. Then he disappears from the family photos after the divorce in 2003."

"And Miles Kowalski," Brandon added, "age twenty-nine, matches the physical description from the youth group photo. Came into the library earlier this year asking Sarah questions. Right age, right access, right background."

"If Kowalski is Marcus Harding, he changed his name at some point."

"After the divorce, maybe. Fresh start, new identity. His mother remarried and became Powell—maybe he took that name for a while, then changed it again."

Matt started the car. "We need to find out for certain. Birth records, name change documents, Social Security records. Something that definitively links Miles Kowalski to Marcus Harding."

"And we need to do it quietly," Brandon said. "If Kowalski is our guy and he finds out we're looking at him—"

"Dale's in federal custody. He's safe."

"But we're not. And neither is anyone else who might know the truth."

They sat in Linda Carpenter's driveway, both of them processing the implications.

If Miles Kowalski was Marcus Harding, if he'd been fixated on Sarah since she was eleven years old, if he'd taken her and killed her and investigated his own crime—then they were looking at a cop who'd successfully hidden in plain sight for six months. Who'd had access to every piece of evidence, every witness statement, every lead.

Who was still out there.

Still wearing a badge.

"Back to the station," Matt said. "We need to pull employment records, background checks, anything the department has on Kowalski. And we need to do it without anyone knowing what we're looking for."

Brandon nodded. His mind was already working through the next steps. Birth certificates. Name change petitions. Adoption records if Jennifer had tried to have Dale legally adopt Marcus.

Somewhere in the paper trail, there would be proof.

They just had to find it before Kowalski realized they were looking.

# Chapter Nine

**Monday Morning**

The federal holding facility was forty minutes north of Indianapolis, tucked between farmland and industrial parks where nobody paid much attention to who came and went. Matt pulled into the visitor lot at nine-fifteen, the morning already bright and cold. Brandon had been quiet during the drive, reviewing the documentation they’d compiled the night before.

Birth certificate for Marcus Robert Harding, born April 3, 1982, in Blackburn, Indiana. Mother: Jennifer Anne Harding. Father: Robert James Harding.

Court petition for legal name change filed in Monroe County, Indiana, December 2004. Marcus Robert Harding to Marcus Robert Powell. Granted January 2005. Even though he was an adult he'd taken his second stepfather's name. His first attempt to run from the boy he'd been.

Second court petition for legal name change filed in Vigo County, Indiana, March 2008. Marcus Robert Powell to Miles Robert Kowalski. Granted April 2008.

Social Security records showing employment history: Miles Robert Kowalski hired by Parke County Sheriff’s Department, August 2009.

“Two name changes,” Matt said as they walked toward the entrance. “First takes his stepfather’s name after the divorce. Then changes completely three years later.”

“Reinvention,” Brandon said. “Or hiding.”

“Both, probably. The second maybe because he didn't want to be associated with his boyhood when he came back home to Parke County."

They checked in at the front desk, showed their credentials, checked their weapons, and were escorted through two sets of security doors to a small conference room. Dale Kovacs sat at a metal table, wearing an orange jumpsuit, hands folded in front of him. He looked tired but calmer than he had on Saturday. Less afraid.

He looked up when they entered. “You found him.”

It wasn’t a question.

Matt sat down across from Dale. Brandon took the chair beside him and pulled out a folder.

“We found evidence of who we believe killed Sarah,” Matt said. “But we need you to confirm it.”

Dale nodded slowly. “Show me.”

Brandon opened the folder and slid a photo across the table. Deputy Miles Kowalski in uniform, official department photo from the sheriff’s website.

Dale stared at the photo for a long moment. His hands trembled slightly.

“That’s him,” Dale said quietly. “That’s Marcus.”

Matt exchanged a glance with Brandon. They’d been ninety percent certain, but hearing Dale confirm it made it real.

“Tell us about Marcus,” Matt said. “Everything. From the beginning.”

Dale took a shaky breath. “I met Jennifer in 1993. She was a widow with two boys—Marcus was eleven, Tyler was three. Their father had died the year before. Cancer. Jennifer was struggling, working two jobs, trying to keep things together. I started helping out. We started dating and eventually got married in June ’94.”

“When did you buy the house?” Brandon asked.

"March ‘94. My parents were getting older, wanted to downsize. They sold me the farm for what I could afford. Jennifer and the boys moved in right after the wedding.” Dale’s expression went distant. “Marcus had a hard time with the transition. New house, new stepfather, still grieving his dad. He’d spend hours in the barn. I fixed up the southeast corner for him—built a little space where he could be alone. Thought it might help him feel like he had something that was his.”

“How was your relationship with him?” Matt asked.

“Complicated. I tried to be a good stepfather. Took him fishing, helped with homework, went to his school events. But he never really warmed to me. Always kept his distance. Polite, but cold.”

“What about with other kids his age?” Brandon asked.

“That was part of the problem. He didn’t connect with kids his own age. The teenagers at church, at school—he didn’t fit in. Too serious, too intense. It got worse as he got older. He was more comfortable around younger kids-Tyler's age.” Dale’s jaw tightened. “I didn’t think much of it at first. Thought he was just immature for his age.”

“When did you realize it was more than that?” Matt asked.

Dale was quiet for a moment. “When he was fifteen. There was a girl at church—Amy something, I can’t remember her last name. She was twelve. Marcus had been paying a lot of attention to her. Walking her to Sunday school, sitting with her at youth group. Her parents thought it was sweet—an older boy looking out for a younger girl. But then Amy told Marcus she didn’t want to hang out with him anymore. That she had a boyfriend her own age.”

“What did Marcus do?” Brandon asked.

“He vandalized her family’s car. Spray-painted horrible things on it. Cruel things.” Dale’s voice shook. “The girl’s parents called the sheriff. But Jennifer and I talked to them, apologized, offered to pay for the damage. We convinced them it was just a stupid teenage prank. That Marcus was going through a hard time, still dealing with his father’s death. They agreed not to involve the police.”

“Did you get Marcus help?” Matt asked. “Counseling, therapy?”

“We tried. Jennifer made him see a counselor for a few months. But Marcus just sat there. Wouldn’t talk. Wouldn’t engage. The counselor said she couldn’t help someone who didn’t want to be helped.” Dale rubbed his face. “I thought maybe he’d grow out of it. That it was just adolescent stupidity.”

“But it wasn’t,” Brandon said.

“No.” Dale looked at the photo of Kowalski again. “About a year later, I noticed Marcus paying attention to another young girl at church. Sarah Carpenter. She’d just lost her father. She was maybe ten or eleven. Marcus was sixteen. He’d talk to her after services, ask her about her dad, how she was coping. At first I thought maybe he was genuinely trying to help—he understood what she was going through.”

“But then it changed,” Matt said.

“I’d catch him watching her. Not just at church, but around town. At the library, at the grocery store. He’d engineer situations to be near her. And Sarah started to seem uncomfortable. She’d avoid him, stay close to her mother. I talked to Jennifer about it. She said I was overreacting. That Marcus was just being kind to a girl who’d lost her father, the way he’d lost his.”

“Did you talk to Marcus directly?” Brandon asked.

“Once. Told him to give Sarah space. That he was making her uncomfortable. He looked at me like I was crazy. Said he was just being friendly. That Sarah was going through what he’d gone through and he wanted to help.” Dale’s hands clenched. “But I saw something in his eyes. Something cold. Like he was daring me to push it further.”

“What happened after that?”

“Things got worse between Jennifer and me. She thought I was being too hard on Marcus. I thought she was enabling him. We fought about it constantly. By 2003, the marriage was over. Jennifer took Tyler and moved to Bloomington. Marcus was twenty-one by then—old enough to be on his own. He left too. Changed his name to Powell, Jennifer’s new married name.”

“Did you stay in touch with him?” Matt asked.

“No. He cut contact completely. I thought that was the end of it. That he was moving on with his life.” Dale’s voice dropped. “Then late last year, I started noticing signs that someone had been in my barn. Tools moved. Things disturbed. It crossed my mind that it might be Marcus. That barn was his space when he was a kid. I think he was coming back to it.”

“Did you confront him?”

“I didn’t know how to find him. He’d changed his name, moved away. And it wasn't a huge concern. I'd only noticed signs he'd been there a couple of times. But then in January, I saw him. At the Rural King in Blackburn. He was in uniform. Deputy sheriff. He didn’t see me, but I recognized him immediately. I'm not sure I would've if I hadn't known him so well. His face had changed a lot as he grew into adulthood. That's when I started stopping by the library, where Sarah worked, more often. I was curious to know if he was watching her.”

“Why not just report it to the sheriff?” Matt asked.

“Because he was the sheriff’s department. And because—” Dale stopped, struggling with the words. “Because part of me still cared about him. He was my stepson for nine years. I raised him. I didn’t want to believe he was dangerous. I thought maybe if I could catch him on camera, I could talk to him. Get him to stop.”

Brandon leaned forward. “Dale, did you know Marcus was fixated on Sarah again?”

Dale’s face crumpled. “I suspected. I did see him at the library a couple times earlier this year. Couldn't tell if he was watching her. I thought about warning her, but what would I say? That my ex-stepson who I hadn’t seen in eight years might be dangerous? Based on what, a feeling?”

“So when you found Sarah in your barn,” Matt said, “you knew immediately it was Marcus.”

“Yes. The blankets, the way she was positioned in that southeast corner—it was his space. He brought her there. Maybe he thought…” Dale’s voice broke. “Maybe he thought he could show her how much she meant to him.”

“Tell us about Marcus’s father,” Brandon said. “Robert Harding.”

“He died when Marcus was ten. Jennifer said Marcus took it hard. Stopped talking for months. Wouldn’t go to school. She had to get him counseling just to function. When I met Marcus two years later, he seemed okay on the surface. But there was something—” Dale searched for the words. “Something frozen about him. Like part of him was still that little boy who’d lost his dad.”

“Disrupted Attachment,” Brandon said quietly.

Matt looked at his partner. Brandon’s expression was carefully neutral, but Matt recognized that look. Brandon was connecting something to his own experience. Maybe to Missouri.

“What do you mean?” Dale asked.

“Sometimes trauma at a critical developmental age can arrest emotional growth,” Brandon explained. “Marcus lost his father at ten. That’s when children are forming their understanding of relationships, attachment, loss. If he never processed that trauma properly, part of him might have remained emotionally ten years old even as he physically aged. He'd have been clingy and controlling in future attachments and prone to rage when rejected.”

“That would explain why he related better to younger children,” Matt added. “Why his fixations were on girls significantly younger than him. He was emotionally closer to their age than to his peers.”

“And when Sarah lost her father at eleven,” Brandon continued, “Marcus saw someone experiencing what he’d experienced. He connected with her in a way he couldn’t connect with girls his own age. But that connection—”

“Turned into obsession,” Dale finished. “Because he couldn’t understand healthy boundaries.”

“Did Marcus have any other violent incidents?” Matt asked. “Besides the vandalism at fifteen?”

“Not that I know of. But after he left, I wasn’t in his life anymore. I don’t know what he did in those years between the divorce and him becoming a deputy.”

Matt made notes. They’d need to check Marcus’s background more thoroughly. College records if he went to college. Work history. Any police reports or complaints.

“Dale,” Brandon said, “when you found Sarah dead in your barn, why didn’t you call 911?”

“Because I knew Marcus was a deputy. I knew he’d have access to everything—the investigation, the evidence, the reports. If I called it in, he’d know. He’d find a way to make it look like I was responsible. I’d kept her in my house for three days. Who would believe I was trying to protect her?”

“So you were more afraid of being blamed than of Marcus himself,” Matt said.

“I was afraid of both. But yes—I knew how it would look. And I knew Marcus was smart enough to use that against me.”

They sat in silence for a moment. Dale stared at the photo of Kowalski, his expression a mix of grief and anger.

“He killed her in my barn,” Dale said quietly. “In the space I built for him. The one place he felt safe as a kid. He turned it into—” His voice broke.

“We’re going to arrest him,” Matt said. “Today. And we’re going to make sure he can’t hurt anyone else.”

Dale looked up, hope and fear mixing in his eyes. “How? You don’t have evidence. It’s just my word against his.”

“We have your statement. We have the connection between Marcus Harding and Miles Kowalski. And we have corroboration from Sarah's mother confirming his childhood fixation-that he'd made her uncomfortable. We have him asking questions at the library earlier this year. It’s circumstantial, but it’s enough to bring him in for questioning.” Matt leaned forward. “And once we start digging into his life, his movements, his background—we’ll find more.”

“What if he lawyers up? What if he doesn’t talk?”

“Then we keep building the case,” Brandon said. “But people like Marcus—people who think they’re smarter than everyone else—they usually want to explain themselves. They want someone to understand why they did what they did.”

“Will you tell Jennifer?” Dale asked. “His mother?”

“Eventually. After the arrest.”

Dale nodded slowly. “She’ll be devastated. She always defended him. Always thought he just needed more understanding, more support. She never saw what he was capable of.”

“Parents rarely do,” Matt said.

They stood to leave. Dale remained seated, still staring at Kowalski’s photo.

"Dale, one last question," Brandon started. "How did you know that Sarah's car had been tampered with? If you weren't the one who took her, how did you know that?"

Dale looked up at them wearily. "He pulled me over on Route 39 in late May, near the Crossroads. Said I was driving erratically. Then he started questioning me about the girl who went missing nearby. Told me I should be careful because police were likely to be suspicious of a man living alone, especially one who drove a dark colored Silverado and had the know-how to tamper with her starter. He remembered that I worked as a mechanic when he was young."

"He was threatening you," Matt said.

"That's how I took it, yes." Dale looked back down at the photo, lines of concern etched across his brow.

Brandon and Matt turned to leave.

“Agent Ellis,” Dale said as they reached the door. “When you arrest him—be careful. Marcus is good at making people underestimate him. He seems calm, reasonable, harmless. But underneath—” He stopped. “Underneath, there’s something broken. Something that never healed.”

“We’ll be careful,” Matt said.

Outside, walking back to the car, Matt turned to Brandon. “Disrupted attachment. That’s what you picked up on in Missouri, isn’t it?”

Brandon didn’t answer immediately. When he did, his voice was quiet. “Trauma changes people. Freezes them in place sometimes. They keep living, keep aging, but part of them stays in that moment. The moment everything broke.”

Matt wanted to ask more, wanted to understand the connection Brandon was making. But Brandon’s expression had closed, the way it always did when Missouri came up.

“Let’s get back to Indianapolis,” Matt said instead. “We need to coordinate with the field office, get a team together for the arrest.”

They drove in silence, both of them thinking about Marcus Harding. About a ten-year-old boy who lost his father. About an fifteen-year-old who vandalized a car because a girl rejected him. About a twenty-nine-year-old deputy sheriff who they believed had strangled a woman in a barn because she didn’t return his feelings.

About all the moments in between where someone could have stopped him.

But didn’t.

-----

**Monday Afternoon**

Miles Kowalski lived in a small rental house on the south edge of Rockville, three blocks from the sheriff’s department. White siding, black shutters, a neat lawn that suggested someone who cared about appearances. His dark green Silverado sat in the driveway.

Matt parked two houses down at two-forty-five PM. Brandon sat in the passenger seat, watching the house. Behind them, in an unmarked sedan, were two agents from the Indianapolis field office—Agent Sarah Chen and Agent David Reeves. Both had been briefed on the situation. Both knew this was a cop they were arresting.

“He’s home,” Brandon said, nodding toward the truck.

Matt checked his phone. Kowalski’s schedule showed he’d worked Sunday overnight, gotten off at seven AM Monday. He should have been sleeping, but lights were on in the house.

“Let’s do this clean,” Matt said into his radio. “Chen and Reeves, you take the back. Gray and I have the front. On my signal.”

Two clicks of acknowledgment.

They got out of the car. Matt could feel his pulse quicken—the familiar pre-arrest adrenaline. Brandon moved beside him, calm and focused. They’d done this dozens of times before, but this one felt different. This was a cop. Someone who’d know the game, know the angles.

They walked up the driveway. Matt positioned himself to the left of the door, Brandon to the right. Matt knocked. Three solid raps.

“Miles Kowalski, FBI. Open the door.”

Movement inside. Footsteps approaching. The door opened.

Miles Kowalski stood there in sweatpants and a t-shirt, barefoot, hair slightly disheveled from sleep. He looked younger than his photo—boyish, almost. His expression was curious but not alarmed.

“Can I help you?” His voice was calm, polite.

Matt held up his badge. “FBI, Mr. Kowalski. We have a warrant for your arrest.”

Something flickered in Kowalski’s eyes—surprise, then calculation. But his expression remained neutral. “What’s this about?”

“The murder of Sarah Carpenter,” Brandon said.

Kowalski’s face went very still. For a moment, Matt thought he might run. But then Kowalski’s shoulders relaxed slightly, and he smiled. Not a nervous smile. A confident one.

“I think there’s been a mistake,” Kowalski said. “I investigated Sarah’s disappearance. I didn’t have anything to do with her death.”

“We can discuss that back at our office,” Matt said. “Turn around, hands behind your back.”

Kowalski didn’t move. “Do I need to call my union rep?”

“You can call whoever you want once we get to Indianapolis. Turn around.”

Kowalski held Matt’s gaze for a long moment. Then he sighed, like this was all a minor inconvenience, and turned around. “This is going to be embarrassing when you realize you’ve got the wrong guy.”

Matt cuffed him while Brandon cleared the doorway. Chen and Reeves appeared from the back, confirming the house was secure.

“We also have a warrant to search the premises,” Matt said. “Agent Chen and Agent Reeves will execute it while we transport you.”

“Search warrant?” Kowalski’s tone was mildly amused. “For what?”

“Evidence related to Sarah Carpenter’s murder.”

“You won’t find anything,” Kowalski said. “Because there’s nothing to find.”

Matt walked him to the car, one hand on Kowalski’s elbow. Brandon followed, scanning the street for observers. A neighbor two houses down had come out to her porch, watching. Word would spread fast in a small town.

They put Kowalski in the back seat. Matt got behind the wheel, Brandon in the passenger seat. As they pulled away, Matt glanced in the rearview mirror. Kowalski sat calmly, looking out the window like he was being driven to a dental appointment, not an interrogation.

“You guys are making a big mistake,” Kowalski said after a few minutes. “I’m a cop. I worked Sarah’s case. You really think I’d investigate my own crime?”

“It’s been done before,” Brandon said without turning around.

“Not by me.” Kowalski leaned back against the seat. “Dale Kovacs is lying to you. Whatever he told you, it’s bullshit. He’s trying to save himself.”

“We haven’t mentioned Dale Kovacs,” Matt said.

Kowalski’s smile faltered for just a second. “He’s the guy you arrested, right? I was there, remember. You found Sarah’s body on his land. Chain in his bedroom. Pretty obvious he’s your guy.”

“Then why are we arresting you?” Brandon asked.

“Because he lied. Told you some story about someone else being responsible. And you believed him.” Kowalski’s voice was calm, reasonable. “Look, I get it. You want to solve this case. You want to give Sarah’s family closure. But you’re barking up the wrong tree.”

Matt didn’t respond. Let Kowalski talk. People who thought they were smart always talked too much.

“I knew Sarah,” Kowalski continued. “She worked at the library. I’d go in there sometimes, check out books. We’d chat. Small talk. That’s it. Nothing weird, nothing inappropriate. Just two people being friendly in a small town.”

“When did you start going to the library?” Brandon asked.

“I don’t know. Earlier this year? February maybe?”

“Why that library? Don’t you live in Rockville?”

“Blackburn’s library is nicer. Best selection in the county.” Kowalski shifted in his seat. “Look, I’m cooperating here. Answering your questions. But I’m going to need to talk to a lawyer before we go much further.”

“That’s your right,” Matt said.

They drove the rest of the way in silence. Kowalski stared out the window, his expression unreadable. But Matt could see the wheels turning behind his eyes. Calculating. Planning.

By the time they reached the Indianapolis FBI office at four-thirty, the sun was getting low in the sky. They brought Kowalski in through the secure entrance, processed him, and placed him in Interview Room Two.

Matt and Brandon watched him through the one-way glass. Kowalski sat at the table, hands cuffed in front of him now, looking around the room with mild interest. Not nervous. Not agitated. Just waiting.

“He thinks he can talk his way out of this,” Brandon said.

“Can he?”

“Not if we do this right.”

Matt’s phone buzzed. A text from Chen: *Found something. Box in closet. Photos, newspaper clippings, church youth group bulletin fro 1998-when he was a kid. All related to Sarah.*

Matt showed the message to Brandon. “Youthful fixation.”

“Enough to show pattern of behavior. Not enough to prove murder.”

“We don’t need to prove murder in the interview. We just need to get him talking. Get him to make a mistake.”

Brandon stared through the glass at Kowalski. “He’s not going to break easily.”

“No. People like him usually do eventually—they want to be understood.”

Matt’s phone rang. Dunham.

“Chief Deputy,” Matt answered.

“Ellis. I heard you arrested Kowalski.” Dunham’s voice was tight, controlled. “Please tell me you have a good reason.”

“We do. We’re about to start the interview. Can you get up here?”

“I’m already on my way. Be there in thirty minutes.” Dunham paused. “I’ve known Miles for over two years. Worked with him every day. This better not be a mistake.”

“It’s not.”

After Dunham hung up, Matt turned to Brandon. “We should wait for Dunham. Brief him first, then go in.”

Brandon nodded, still watching Kowalski through the glass.

Miles Kowalski sat patiently, waiting to explain why they were wrong.

Waiting to convince them he was innocent.

But in that box in his closet, surrounded by photos of a girl who’d died in a barn, the truth was already speaking louder than any words he could say.

# Chapter Ten
**Monday Evening**

Brandon stood in front of the one-way glass, watching Miles Kowalski sit motionless at the metal table in Interview Room Two. The observation room was small and dark, just enough space for three people to stand comfortably. Matt was on the phone with the Indianapolis field office supervisor, giving an update. Brandon tuned him out.

Kowalski's hands rested flat on the table, palms down. His posture was relaxed—shoulders back, spine straight but not rigid. He'd been sitting like that for twenty minutes, barely moving except to blink. Most people in an interrogation room fidgeted. Tapped fingers. Shifted weight. Checked the clock on the wall. Kowalski just sat.

But there were tells if you knew where to look.

His right index finger moved in small circles against the table surface. Unconscious. A self-soothing gesture. And every thirty seconds or so, his eyes would flick to the mirror—not obviously, just a quick glance—checking to see if anyone was watching.

Someone who thought he was in control. Someone who'd practiced being calm under pressure. Maybe had practiced it in front of a mirror.

Someone who was working very hard to appear like he had nothing to hide.

Brandon had seen that before. The ones who were truly innocent looked different. They were confused, frustrated, sometimes angry. They wanted to know why they were there, what the hell was going on. They didn't sit perfectly still with practiced calm.

The people who sat like Kowalski were the ones who'd been preparing for this moment. Who'd thought through what they'd say, how they'd act, what mask they'd wear.

The door behind Brandon opened. Chief Deputy Dunham walked in, his face drawn and tired. He'd made the drive from Rockville in under forty minutes.

Matt ended his call and turned. "Tom."

Dunham nodded to both of them, then looked through the glass at Kowalski. "I need to hear it. All of it. Why you think one of my deputies murdered Sarah Carpenter."

Matt pulled out a folder and opened it on the small desk beneath the window. "His real name is Marcus Robert Harding. He's Dale Kovacs's former stepson. He lived on that property from age twelve to twenty-one. According to Kovacs, he spent a lot of time in the barn where we found the bracelet."

Dunham stared at the documents. Birth certificate. Name change petitions. Employment records.

"He developed a fixation on Sarah when she was eleven and he was seventeen," Brandon said quietly. "Both had lost their fathers. He saw it as a connection. But Sarah felt uncomfortable around him. Her mother confirmed it."

"That was over ten years ago," Dunham said. "Kids are weird. They grow out of things."

"Some do," Brandon said. "Marcus didn't. We found a box in his closet. Photos of Sarah. Newspaper clippings about her disappearance. A church bulletin from 1998 when they were both in youth group together. He's been holding onto this for over a decade."

Dunham was quiet for a long moment, staring through the glass. "I hired him two years ago. Did a full background check. Nothing came up."

"As far as we can tell, he doesn't have a record," Matt said. "Plus he's been through two name changes. His record is clean. But we have a statement that he lashed out at least once before when a girl rejected him. And the girl's family will be able to corroborate that."

"Jesus." Dunham rubbed his face. "I worked with him almost every day. How did I not see it?"

"Because he's good at hiding," Brandon said. "He's had years of practice."

Through the glass, Kowalski shifted slightly in his chair. His eyes went to the mirror again. Longer this time. Like he knew they were talking about him.

"What's your plan for the interview?" Dunham asked.

"We present the evidence," Matt said. "Show him we know who he really is. Give him the opportunity to explain."

"You think he'll talk without a lawyer?"

"I think his ego won't let him stay quiet," Brandon said. "He thinks he's smarter than us. He'll want to prove it."

Dunham looked at Brandon, then at Matt. "You're sure about this. Because if you're wrong—"

"We're not wrong," Matt said.

Dunham exhaled slowly. "All right. I'll watch from here. But Ellis—if this goes sideways, it's on you."

"Understood."

Matt gathered the folder and looked at Brandon. "Ready?"

Brandon nodded. But he took one more moment to study Kowalski through the glass.

Twenty-nine years old. Deputy sheriff. Clean record. Friendly face. The kind of person who'd blend into a small town, who'd be trusted, who'd be above suspicion.

But Brandon could tell that friendly face was a well-rehearsed mask. Underneath lurked something frozen and broken. A ten-year-old boy who'd never fully processed his father's death. Who'd found another grieving child and mistaken her pain for connection. Who'd built that connection into something twisted and possessive over thirteen years.

And when that fantasy finally shattered—when Sarah rejected him again, when Dale took her away from him, when she asked him "why"—that broken thing inside him had lashed out.

Brandon pulled his attention back to the present. Took a breath. Centered himself.

Then he and Matt walked out of the observation room and down the short hallway to Interview Room Two.

---

The door opened and Marcus Kowalski looked up. His expression shifted to mild curiosity, like they were colleagues meeting for coffee instead of an interrogation.

"Agents," he said. "Long wait. Was starting to think you'd forgotten about me."

Matt closed the door and sat down across from Kowalski. Brandon took the chair beside Matt, setting a folder on the table between them.

"Mr. Kowalski," Matt started, "before we begin, I need to inform you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand these rights?"

"I do," Kowalski said.

"Do you wish to have an attorney present?"

Kowalski smiled. Not nervous. Confident. "I don't think that's necessary. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm happy to answer your questions."

Matt slid a form across the table. "P sign this Miranda waiver stating you are waiving your right to an attorney at this time."

Kowalski picked up the pen Matt handed him and scribbled his signature with one fluid stroke. He handed the pen back and placed his hands flat on the table again.

Brandon watched Kowalski's hands. Flat on the table. His index finger resumed making those small circles. The self-soothing gesture hadn't stopped.

"Good," Matt said. "Then let's start with something simple. How long have you lived in Rockville?"

"About two and a half years. I moved there in early 2009 when I got hired by the sheriff's department."

"And before that?"

"Bloomington. I was going to school at IU."

"What did you study?"

"Criminal justice. Graduated in 2008."

Matt nodded, writing. "And before Bloomington?"

Kowalski hesitated. Just a fraction of a second. "I moved around a bit. Lived in Terre Haute for a while."

"What about when you were younger? Where did you grow up?"

"Different places," Kowalski said. His tone was still casual, but Brandon saw the shift in his posture. Shoulders tensing slightly. "My mom moved a few times after my dad died."

"Your father," Matt said. "Robert Harding."

Kowalski went very still. "How do you know my father's name?"

"Because we know who you are, Marcus."

The air in the room changed. Kowalski's expression didn't shift much—just a slight tightening around his eyes—but Brandon felt it. A slight crack appeared in his mask.

"I don't know what you're talking about," Kowalski said.

Brandon spoke for the first time since entering the room. His voice was quiet, gentle. "Your father died when you were ten. Cancer. That must have been devastating."

Kowalski looked at him. "A lot of kids lose parents. It doesn't make them murderers."

"We're not saying it does," Brandon said. "But it changes you. Leaves a...a mark. Trauma always does. Makes it hard to form attachments later. Leaves you Feeling frozen in time. Like you were stuck being that ten-year-old boy even as you got older."

Something flickered across Kowalski's face. Recognition, maybe. Or surprise that someone understood.

"I got therapy," Kowalski said. "I dealt with it."

"Did you?" Brandon asked. "Because two years after your father died, your mother married Dale Kovacs. And you moved to a farm on County Road 275. That must have been hard. New stepfather. New house. Still grieving."

"Dale was fine," Kowalski said. His voice had gone flat. "He tried. But he wasn't my dad."

"No," Brandon agreed. "He wasn't. But he gave you space. Built you a place in the barn where you could be alone. That southeast corner. That was yours."

Kowalski's breathing had changed. Faster. Shallower.

"How do you know about that?" he asked.

Matt opened the folder. "Because we've talked to Dale. And he told us everything, Marcus."

"Stop calling me that," Kowalski said. "My name is Miles."

"Is it?" Matt slid a document across the table. "Because according to Monroe County records, you legally changed your name from Marcus Robert Harding to Marcus Robert Powell in January 2005. Then three years later, in Vigo County, you changed it again. Marcus Robert Powell to Miles Robert Kowalski."

Kowalski stared at the documents. "People change their names. It's not illegal."

"No, it's not," Matt said. "But it's interesting. Why did you change your name twice?"

"Fresh start," Kowalski said. "After the divorce, my mom remarried. I took her new husband's name. Then later I wanted something completely different."

"Or you wanted to hide," Brandon said. "You wanted to come back to Parke County without anyone recognizing you. Without anyone connecting you to the boy who used to live on Dale Kovacs's farm."

"I'm not hiding anything."

Matt slid another document across the table. "This is a statement from Linda Carpenter. Sarah's mother. She remembers you from church. Says you paid a lot of attention to Sarah when she was eleven years old. Right after HER father died. Made her uncomfortable enough that she asked to skip youth group for a while."

Kowalski's jaw tightened. "I was trying to help her. She was going through what I went through. I thought I could—" He stopped himself.

"You thought you could what?" Brandon asked gently.

"Nothing. I was seventeen. I was trying to be nice to a kid who'd lost her dad. That's it."

"But it wasn't just being nice, was it?" Brandon said. "You felt a connection to her. Someone who understood what you'd been through. Who knew what it was like to lose a parent that young."

Kowalski didn't respond.

Matt pulled out another photo. The box from Kowalski's closet. Photos of Sarah spread out on a table.

"We found this in your house," Matt said. "Photos of Sarah Carpenter. Newspaper clippings about her disappearance. A church bulletin from 1998 with both your names circled. You've been holding onto this for twelve years, Marcus."

"Stop calling me that," Kowalski said again. His voice was strained now.

"Why did you keep these?" Brandon asked.

"I don't know. I just—" Kowalski looked at the photos. "She mattered to me. When we were kids. I thought about her sometimes. Wondered how she was doing. That's not a crime."

"No," Matt said. "But murder is."

"I didn't murder anyone." Kowalski's voice rose slightly. "Dale is lying to you. He's the one who had Sarah in his house. He's the one who buried her body. And you're believing him over me because of some old photos?"

"We also have a witness," Matt said. "Who saw a dark-colored Silverado at the Crossroads Mini-Mart the night Sarah disappeared. It had a decal on the back window. You drive a dark green Silverado with a Browning decal on the back window."

"So do half the guys in this county."

"But most of them didn't know Sarah," Brandon said. "Most of them didn't have a childhood obsession with her. Most of them didn't change their name twice and come back to Parke County to work as a deputy sheriff in the same town where she lived."

Kowalski was breathing hard now. The crack growing wider.

"You started going to the library earlier this year," Matt said. "February, you told us in the car. The librarian remembers you. Says you asked Sarah questions about her job. About her schedule. You were gathering information."

"I was being friendly," Kowalski said. His hands formed fists on the table. "That's what people do in small towns. They talk to each other. It doesn't prove anything."

"About six months before Sarah was murdered, Dale noticed someone had been coming on his land, spending time in his barn. We think it was you," Brandon said quietly. "We think you'd been visiting that barn. Maybe because it reminded you of when you were younger. When things were simpler. Before Dale and your mother divorced. Before everything fell apart."

"You don't know what you're talking about."

"We think you were in Blackburn while you were on duty on April 16th. Saw Sarah's car at the library that day," Brandon continued. "Maybe you'd been watching her, waiting for an opportunity. And you sabotaged it. Loosened the connection to the starter so it wouldn't catch right. So she'd be stranded."

"That's insane."

"You knew she'd stop at the Crossroads," Matt said. "If you'd been watching her. She always got gas there on her way home from her Thursday shift. So you waited. And when her car wouldn't start, when she was alone at that payphone—you approached her."

Kowalski shook his head. "No. That's not—I didn't—"

"She knew you," Brandon said. "Recognized the friendly deputy sheriff who sometimes stopped by the library. You told her you were there to help. That you could help her with her car."

"Stop," Kowalski said.

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until you grabbed her and pulled her into your truck."

"I said stop!"

Matt leaned forward. "Where did you take her, Marcus? To Dale's barn? Your old hideout?"

Kowalski's breathing was ragged now. His composure crumbling. "I didn't hurt her. I was trying to protect her."

"Protect her from what?" Brandon asked.

"From Dale!" Kowalski's voice cracked. "He was watching her. Following her. I saw him at the library all the time. I knew what he was doing. He's sick. He always was. And I couldn't let him—I had to—"

He stopped. Realized what he'd said. His face went pale.

"You took her to the barn," Brandon said gently. "To protect her from Dale."

Kowalski didn't respond. His hands were shaking.

"You were the first officer on scene after the call came in about Sarah," Brandon continued. "You must have drugged her to make sure she wouldn't get away. Did you take her to Dale's barn before you responded to the scene or after?"

Kowalski's eyes filled with tears.

"Dale found her," Matt said. "Broke the chain. Kept her in his house for three days. You must have realized that when you went back the next night and she wasn't in the barn where you'd left her."

"When he finally left on the third day, you went back for her," Brandon said. "Took her to your barn. To save her from Dale."

Kowalski wiped his eyes. "She was supposed to understand. I explained it to her. Told her Dale was dangerous. That I'd been watching him. That I was there to protect her. But she wouldn't listen. She kept asking to go home. Kept saying I was scaring her."

"What happened in the barn, Marcus?" Brandon asked quietly.

Kowalski's face crumpled. "I just wanted to talk to her. To make her understand. But she kept pulling away. Kept trying to scream. I just needed her to be quiet. To listen."

Brandon could feel it now. The impression from that barn. The terror. The desperate need to make someone understand. The hands closing around a throat. The moment everything went wrong.

"She asked you why," Brandon said. His voice was barely above a whisper.

Kowalski looked up sharply.

"Not 'why are you doing this,'" Brandon continued. "Just 'why.' One word. That's all she said before you put your hands on her throat."

The color drained from Kowalski's face. His mouth opened but no sound came out.

"How did you know that?" he whispered.

Brandon didn't answer. He just held Kowalski's gaze.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski said again, louder now. "No one—Dale wasn't there—no one could have—"

The room went silent.

Brandon could feel Matt's incredulous gaze boring a hole in him. And through the one-way glass, Dunham was watching. Both of them trying to understand what had just happened.

But Brandon kept his eyes on Marcus Kowalski as the man across from him began to shake, his carefully constructed mask finally, completely shattered.

# Chapter Eleven
**Monday Evening**

Matt had been taking notes when Brandon said it. He'd been writing down the timeline—Marcus taking Sarah to the barn, drugging her, Dale finding her—when his partner's voice went quiet and said something that made no sense.

"She asked you why. Not 'why are you doing this.' Just 'why.' One word. That's all she said before you put your hands on her throat."

Matt's pen stopped moving.

That wasn't in Dale's statement. Dale hadn't been there for the murder. He'd found Sarah's body after. There was no way Brandon could know what Sarah had said in her final moments.

Unless—

Matt looked up from his notes. Kowalski had gone completely white. His mouth hung open, no sound coming out.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski whispered.

Brandon didn't answer. He just held Kowalski's gaze with that same quiet intensity he'd had throughout the interview.

"How did you know that?" Kowalski said again, his voice rising. "No one—Dale wasn't there—no one could have—"

Matt's mind raced. Brandon had said something he couldn't possibly know. Something specific enough that Kowalski recognized it as true. Which meant either Brandon had guessed—impossibly lucky—or...

Or Brandon really did see things. Know things. In ways Matt had never fully understood.

Matt had worked with Brandon for three years. He'd watched his partner stand at crime scenes and reconstruct events with uncanny accuracy. He'd heard Brandon describe victim psychology, perpetrator motivation, timelines and sequences that later proved correct. Matt had always assumed it was just exceptional observational skills. Pattern recognition. Experience.

But this wasn't observation. This was knowledge. Specific, impossible knowledge.

Kowalski's hands were shaking on the table. His breathing had gone ragged. The mask he'd practiced so arduously—the calm, confident deputy—had shattered completely.

Brandon leaned forward slightly. His voice was still gentle, almost compassionate.

"You told her you loved her," Brandon said. "You said it three times while your hands were around her neck. You needed her to know."

Kowalski made a sound—half sob, half gasp. "Stop. Please stop."

"She couldn't breathe," Brandon continued. "But she heard you. In those last moments, she heard you saying you loved her."

"How?" Kowalski's voice broke. "How do you know these things?"

Matt wanted to ask the same question. He wanted to stop the interview, pull Brandon aside, demand an explanation. But he couldn't. Not now. Not when Kowalski was breaking.

"It doesn't matter how," Brandon said quietly. "What matters is what happened. And why."

Kowalski put his head in his hands. His shoulders shook. When he looked up, tears streamed down his face.

"I loved her," he said. "I loved her since we were kids. Since I saw her at church after her dad died. She understood. She was the only one who understood what it felt like."

"You were both grieving," Brandon said.

"Yes." Kowalski wiped his eyes. "Everyone else—they didn't get it. They'd say stupid things like 'he's in a better place' or 'time heals all wounds.' But Sarah—she knew. She knew what it was like to have that hole inside you that nothing could fill."

"So you connected with her," Matt said, finding his voice.

"I tried to help her. I'd talk to her at church, at youth group. Tell her it was okay to be sad. That she didn't have to pretend everything was fine." Kowalski's voice was desperate now, pleading. "I was trying to be there for her. The way I wished someone had been there for me."

"But she pulled away," Brandon said.

"Her mother." Kowalski's expression hardened. "Linda. She told Sarah I was too old to be hanging around her. That it wasn't appropriate. She turned Sarah against me."

"Sarah was eleven," Matt said. "You were seventeen."

"That didn't matter!" Kowalski's voice rose. "Age is just a number. What mattered was that we understood each other. That we had this connection. But they took that away from me."

Matt made notes, keeping his expression neutral. The delusion was complete. Kowalski genuinely believed a seventeen-year-old's fixation on an eleven-year-old was appropriate. That a child's grief created some kind of romantic bond.

"So you left," Brandon said. "After Dale and your mother divorced."

"I had to. Dale made it clear I wasn't welcome. He knew about Sarah. Thought there was something wrong with me. And my mom—she always took his side." Kowalski wiped his face again. "I changed my name. Started over. Went to college. Tried to move on."

"But you couldn't," Matt said.

"I thought about her all the time. Wondered how she was doing. If she was okay. If she still thought about me." Kowalski looked at the photos spread on the table. "When I graduated from the police academy, I knew I wanted to come back. To make sure she was safe."

"Safe from what?" Brandon asked.

"From people who'd want to hurt her. She was so fragile after she lost her dad." Kowalski's jaw tightened. "I became a cop so I could protect her. So I could watch over her without anyone questioning it."

Matt felt something cold settle in his chest. Kowalski had planned this for years. Changed his name, became a police officer, got hired in Parke County—all so he could be near Sarah without being recognized as the teenager who'd made her uncomfortable.

"And when you saw Dale at the library," Brandon said, "you thought he was a threat."

"I knew what he was capable of. I grew up with him. He had this way of watching people. Studying them. And when I saw him at the library, saw him watching Sarah—" Kowalski shook his head. "I knew I had to do something."

Matt knew they could explain to him that Dale was only at the library so much because he was concerned that Kowalski still had an unhealthy interest in Sarah, but it wouldn't change how he felt about it. This 29 year old man in front of them was still processing the situation like an adolescent. 

"So you took her," Matt said.

"I saved her." Kowalski's voice was firm. "I saw her car at the library that day. I was on patrol in Blackburn. I knew she'd be finishing her shift soon. So I made sure her car adolescentwouldn't start. Made sure she'd be stranded."

"And you waited at the Crossroads," Brandon said.

"I knew she'd stop there. She always did on Thursdays. I parked where I could see the payphone, where I could watch." Kowalski's expression softened. "She looked so scared when her car wouldn't start. I just wanted to help her. To let her know everything would be okay."

"But you drugged her," Matt said.

"I had to. She was panicking. I told her I was there to help, that I'd take her somewhere safe. But she wouldn't calm down. She kept asking questions. So I gave her something to help her relax."

"Rohypnol?" Matt asked.

Kowalski nodded. "Just enough to keep her calm. I didn't want to hurt her."

"Where did you take her?"

"To Dale's barn. My old space. The corner he'd built for me." Kowalski's voice went distant. "I thought—I thought if I could just talk to her there, in a place that meant something to me, she'd understand. She'd see that I was trying to protect her."

"But Dale found her," Brandon said.

"I had to respond to the call about her disappearance. I couldn't—I couldn't stay with her." Kowalski's hands clenched. "When I went back the next night, she was gone. Dale had taken her. Put her in his house. Locked her up like an animal."

"So you waited," Matt said. "Waited for Dale to leave."

"Three days. Three days watching his property. Waiting for my chance." Kowalski's voice shook. "When he finally left on Friday, I broke in. Found her in that bedroom. She was so scared. So confused. I tried to explain that Dale was dangerous, that I'd saved her from him. But she wouldn't listen."

"You took her back to the barn," Brandon said quietly.

"I had to. Dale would be back. I needed somewhere we could talk without being interrupted." Kowalski looked at his hands. "I thought—I thought if I could just make her understand—"

"But she didn't understand," Matt said.

"She kept asking to go home. Kept saying she wanted her mother. I tried to explain that I loved her. That I'd always loved her. That everything I'd done was to keep her safe." Kowalski's voice cracked. "But she looked at me like I was a monster."

The room was quiet for a moment. Matt could hear the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, the distant sound of voices in the hallway outside.

"What happened then?" Brandon asked. His voice was so gentle it was almost a whisper.

Kowalski's face crumpled. "She tried to scream. I couldn't—I couldn't let her scream. Someone might hear. So I put my hands on her throat. Just to quiet her. Just until she calmed down."

"But she didn't calm down," Matt said.

"She fought. Clawed at the ground. At my hands. I kept telling her it was okay. That I loved her. That everything would be okay if she just stopped fighting." Kowalski was crying now, tears streaming down his face. "I said it three times. 'I love you. I love you. I love you.' I needed her to know. I needed her to understand before—"

He stopped. His whole body shaking.

"Before she died," Brandon finished.

Kowalski nodded, sobbing. "I didn't mean to. I just wanted her to be quiet. To listen. But she kept fighting and then—then she stopped. And I realized—" His voice broke completely. "I realized what I'd done."

Matt set down his pen. They had it. A full confession. On tape. Witnessed by Dunham through the glass.

"What did you do with her body?" Matt asked.

"I left her there. In the barn. In my corner. I couldn't—I couldn't move her. Couldn't touch her." Kowalski wiped his eyes. "I went home. Tried to figure out what to do. I expected there to be a call the next day. I expected Dale to report finding her body."

"Except he didn't report it," Brandon said.

"No. He buried her. The coward buried her." Kowalski's expression hardened. "He knew if they found her on his land, after he'd kept her in his house, they'd blame him. So he buried her and kept quiet."

"And you let him," Matt said. "You knew where Sarah was. You knew what had happened to her. But you kept investigating the case. Kept interviewing witnesses. Kept pretending you didn't know."

"I had to. If I'd said anything, they'd know I was involved." Kowalski looked between them. "You have to understand. I didn't want to hurt her. I loved her. I was trying to protect her."

"From Dale," Brandon said.

"Yes. From Dale. But really from anyone who'd want to hurt her." Kowalski's voice was pleading now. "She was supposed to understand. We were supposed to be together. It wasn't supposed to end like this."

Matt closed his notebook. "I think that's all we need. You'll be transported to a holding facility pending arraignment."

Kowalski didn't resist. He just sat there, tears still streaming down his face, broken and defeated.

"I loved her," he said again, quietly. "I just wanted her to know."

---

They left Kowalski in the interview room with two agents guarding the door. Matt and Brandon walked down the hallway in silence. Dunham met them outside the observation room, his face pale.

"Jesus Christ," Dunham said. "I worked with him for two years. Rode in a car with him. Had coffee with him. And I never—" He stopped, shaking his head.

"He's good at hiding," Matt said. "He's had years of practice."

"The things he said. The way he justified it." Dunham looked back toward the interview room. "He really believes he loved her. That he was protecting her."

"People like Marcus build narratives that let them live with themselves," Brandon said. "He's been telling himself this story for thirteen years. That he and Sarah had a special connection. That everyone else was wrong. That he was the hero."

"Will the confession hold up in court?" Dunham asked.

"He was Mirandized. He waived his right to counsel in writing. The confession was voluntary." Matt felt the weight of the day settling on him. "It'll hold."

Dunham nodded slowly. "I'll coordinate with the prosecutor's office. Start the paperwork." He paused. "Good work. Both of you. I don't know how you broke him, but—good work."

After Dunham left, Matt turned to Brandon. His partner stood with his arms crossed, staring at nothing.

"Gray," Matt said quietly.

Brandon looked at him.

"We need to talk."

---

They found an empty conference room on the second floor. Matt closed the door and leaned against it. Brandon sat at the table, his expression carefully neutral.

"How did you know?" Matt asked.

"Know what?"

"Don't." Matt's voice was firm. "Don't pretend you don't know what I'm asking. You said things in that interview that you couldn't possibly know. Specific things. About what Sarah said. About what Marcus said. Things that weren't in any report or witness statement."

Brandon was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was measured. "Sometimes at crime scenes, I get impressions. Images. Like echoes of what happened there."

"Impressions."

"I don't know what else to call it." Brandon looked at his hands. "It's not like I hear voices or see ghosts. It's more like—like my brain processes the physical evidence and the psychological context and creates a reconstruction. But it feels more vivid than just theory. More certain."

"You saw what happened in that barn," Matt said.

"I felt it. Both times we were there. The fear. The desperation. The moment Sarah realized she wasn't going to survive." Brandon's jaw tightened. "And I felt Marcus too. The need to make her understand. The love twisted up with control. The moment it all went wrong."

Matt sat down across from his partner. "How long have you been able to do this?"

"Since I was ten."

"Missouri," Matt said.

Brandon nodded slowly. "The case I told you about. A woman taken from a phone booth. I went to that scene. I saw—" He stopped, his expression closing. "That's when it started. The impressions. The knowing things I shouldn't know. It's like the trauma experienced at these scenes leaves an mark that I can find."

"The boyfriend," Matt said, remembering Brandon's reaction when they'd talked about the Ashford case. The anger when Matt had suggested the boyfriend might be involved. "You said he was beyond reproach."

Brandon looked up, and Matt saw something in his eyes—pain, old and deep.

"He was my brother, Tom," Brandon said quietly. "The woman who was taken—she was his girlfriend. His fiance really, but he hadn't bought her a ring yet. He was on the phone with her when it happened. Heard the whole thing. Tried to get there in time but couldn't."

Matt felt like the air had been punched out of his lungs. "Jesus, Gray."

"That case was never solved. Early on, the town rumor mill thought Tom might have had something to do with it. My brother spent years trying to find answers. Trying to find her. It destroyed him." Brandon's voice was flat, carefully controlled. "And I was ten years old, trying to understand what had happened. Trying to make sense of it. I visited the scene multiple times, and that's when I started seeing things. Knowing things. Like some part of me broke open that day and never closed."

"Is it real?" Matt asked. "Or is it just—"

"I don't know." Brandon looked at him directly. "I've asked myself that for over twenty years. Is it some kind of ability? Or am I just very good at reading evidence and my brain presents it as certainty? I honestly don't know, Matt. But it works. It helps me solve cases. So I use it."

Matt thought about the past three years. All the times Brandon had reconstructed crime scenes with uncanny accuracy. All the times he'd described victim psychology or perpetrator motivation that later proved correct. Matt had assumed it was skill and experience.

It was those things, but now he knew it was also something else. Something inexplicable.

"Does it always work?" Matt asked.

"No. Sometimes I don't get anything-maybe the trauma response isn't strong enough. Sometimes the impressions are vague, unclear. And sometimes—" Brandon paused. "Sometimes I'm wrong. I try to verify everything I can. I don't make accusations based solely on impressions. But in interviews, when I need to break someone—"

"You use it," Matt finished.

"Yes."

They sat in silence for a moment. Matt's mind was still trying to process what he'd just learned. That his partner had some kind of inexplicable ability. That Brandon had been carrying this since he was ten years old. That the Missouri case had been personal in ways Matt had never understood.

"The things you said in there," Matt said. "About Sarah asking 'why.' About Marcus saying 'I love you' three times. You knew those things. Kowalski's reaction proved it."

"Yes."

"How?"

"I don't know, Matt. I stood in that barn and I felt what happened there."

Matt leaned back in his chair. "This is going to sound crazy, but—do you think you're psychic?"

"I don't believe in psychics," Brandon said. "I think there's probably a rational explanation. Maybe I'm picking up on micro-expressions, body language, environmental cues that my conscious mind doesn't register but my subconscious processes. Maybe I'm just very good at reading crime scenes and my brain can fill in the gaps."

"But you don't know for sure."

"No. I don't know for sure." Brandon met his eyes. "Does it matter?"

Matt thought about that. Did it matter if Brandon's ability was supernatural or just an exceptional skill? The results were the same. Cases got solved. Killers got caught. Justice was served.

But it did matter. Because if Brandon really could see things that happened at crime scenes, really could know details he had no way of knowing—that changed everything.

"Yeah," Matt said finally. "It matters. Because I need to know if what you're telling me in investigations is based on evidence or on something I can't verify. I need to know if I can trust—" He stopped.

"If you can trust me," Brandon finished. His voice was quiet. "That's what you're really asking."

"I do trust you, Gray. You're my partner. But this—" Matt gestured helplessly. "This is a lot."

"I know." Brandon stood. "I've never told anyone before. About the impressions. About how I work cases. I just let people assume I'm good at my job. Which I am. But there's—there's something else too. And I don't understand it any better than you do."

Matt stood as well. "The confession will hold. We have enough physical evidence to corroborate it—the box in his closet, the name changes, witness statements. We don't need—we don't need whatever this is."

"I know."

"But Jesus, Gray. You should have told me. Three years working together and you never—"

"I was afraid," Brandon said. His voice was barely audible. "Afraid you'd think I was crazy. Afraid you wouldn't want to work with me anymore. Afraid—" He stopped.

Matt understood. Brandon had been carrying this alone since he was ten years old. This thing he couldn't explain, couldn't prove, could barely articulate. And he'd been afraid that if anyone knew, they'd see him as broken. As unreliable. It wasn't that different from the trauma that Marcus Harding had carried.

"I don't think you're crazy," Matt said. "I think—I think you have something I don't understand. But I've seen it work. I've seen you solve cases that should have been unsolvable. So whatever this is—" He paused. "We'll figure it out. Together."

Brandon nodded, relief visible in his expression.

"But Gray," Matt added, his voice firm. "No more secrets. If there's something else I need to know—about you, about how you work, about anything—you tell me. We're partners. That means we trust each other with everything."

"Okay," Brandon said. "No more secrets."

They stood there for a moment, the weight of the confession and the revelation hanging between them.

"We should get back," Matt said finally. "Finish processing Kowalski. Make sure everything's documented properly."

"Yeah."

As they walked toward the door, Matt stopped. "Your brother. The one from Missouri. Did he ever—did he ever find peace with it?"

Brandon's expression went distant. "No. He's still looking for her. Still trying to solve it. Some people—some cases—they never let you go."

Matt understood. Sarah Carpenter's case would have been like that for Linda Carpenter. For Thorndale. A wound that never healed because there were no answers.

But now there were answers. Because Brandon Gray had stood in a barn and felt what happened there. Had sat across from a killer and known things he couldn't possibly know.

And Matt still didn't understand how. But he was starting to accept that maybe understanding wasn't the point.

Maybe some things just were.

# Chapter Twelve
**Thursday Morning**

The federal holding facility looked the same as it had four days ago when they'd first interviewed Dale Kovacs. Same parking lot, same industrial landscape, same sense of existing between places. Brandon watched Matt park the sedan in a visitor spot, neither of them in a hurry to get out.

"You ready for this?" Matt asked.

Brandon nodded. They'd spent the past three days processing Marcus Kowalski's confession, coordinating with the prosecutor's office, writing reports. The arraignment was scheduled for Monday. But today they were here for Dale.

"He's taking the plea," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

"He'd be stupid not to," Brandon said. "Three counts: kidnapping, obstruction of justice, improper disposal of human remains. The prosecutor's offering five years with parole eligibility after three, contingent on his testimony at trial."

"Better than life without parole."

"Much better." Brandon opened his door. "He cooperated. Without his statement, we might not have connected Marcus to the case. That counts for something."

They walked across the parking lot. The morning was cold, the sky that flat gray that promised snow. Brandon pulled his jacket tighter. He'd barely slept the past few days. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that barn. Felt Sarah's terror. Heard that single word: *why*.

Matt glanced at him as they approached the entrance. "You okay?"

"Yeah."

"You sure? Because we can have someone else handle this if—"

"I'm fine, Matt." Brandon stopped walking. "I appreciate you checking. But I'm fine."

Matt studied him for a moment, then nodded. This was new—Matt being more attentive, more aware. Since Monday night, since the confession, things between them had shifted. Not in a bad way. Just different. Matt knew now. About the impressions, about how Brandon worked. And instead of pulling back, Matt had leaned in. Asking questions. Trying to understand.

It was strange having someone know. But also—in many ways-it was a relief.

They checked in at the front desk, surrendered their weapons, went through security. The guard escorted them to the same conference room they'd used before. Dale sat at the table, wearing an orange jumpsuit, his hands folded in front of him. His lawyer, Gerald Hicks, sat beside him with a folder open.

Dale looked up when they entered. He'd aged in the past week. New lines around his eyes, gray at his temples that Brandon hadn't noticed before.

"Agents," Hicks said, standing to shake their hands. "Thank you for coming. I know this isn't required but Dale wanted to speak with you before we finalize the plea."

"We're glad to be here," Matt said.

They sat down across from Dale and Hicks. Brandon pulled out his notebook more out of habit than necessity. This wasn't an interrogation.

"The prosecutor's office sent over the final terms yesterday," Hicks said. He slid a document across the table. "Five years, credit for time served, parole eligibility after three years. In exchange for guilty pleas on all three counts and full cooperation including testimony at trial."

Matt scanned the document. "This is contingent on his testimony being truthful and complete."

"We understand," Hicks said. "Dale's prepared to testify to everything he told you. About Marcus, about finding Sarah, about what he did afterward."

"And the prosecutor knows that testimony will include admitting he held Sarah in his house for three days without calling authorities," Matt said. "That he disposed of her body. That he destroyed evidence."

"Yes." Hicks looked at Dale. "My client understands the implications. But he also understands that without his cooperation, Marcus Kowalski might never have been caught."

Dale spoke for the first time. His voice was hoarse. "I want to do this. I want to testify. Sarah deserves that. Her mother deserves that."

Brandon watched Dale's face. The guilt there was real. The remorse. But also fear—fear of what testifying would mean, fear of the consequences of his choices.

"The trial's scheduled for March," Matt said. "You'll likely testify in early April. Defense will probably cross-examine you aggressively. Try to make you look like the real killer and suggest Marcus's confession was coerced."

"I know," Dale said. "Mr. Hicks explained all that."

"And you're still willing?"

"Yes." Dale's jaw set. "I made some terrible mistakes. But I didn't kill Sarah. Marcus did. And I need to make sure everyone knows that."

Matt nodded and pushed the document back across the table. "Then I think this is a fair deal. Agent Gray?"

Brandon had been quiet, just watching. Now he leaned forward slightly. "Mr. Kovacs, do you understand that even with this plea, even with cooperation, you'll still serve time? That you'll have a felony record?"

"I understand."

"And you're accepting that?"

"What choice do I have?" Dale's voice cracked. "I can't undo what I did. Can't bring Sarah back. The least I can do is tell the truth about what happened."

"The truth helps," Brandon said. "It won't erase what you did. But it helps."

Dale nodded, tears forming in his eyes. Hicks handed him a tissue.

"There's one more thing," Dale said after a moment. He wiped his eyes. "Something I need to ask."

"Go ahead," Matt said.

Dale looked directly at Brandon. "If I'd called 911 that first morning—when I found her in the barn, when she was still alive—could I have saved her?"

The room went quiet. Hicks shifted uncomfortably. Matt's pen stopped moving.

Brandon held Dale's gaze. This was the question that had been eating at Dale for six months. The question that would eat at him for the rest of his life.

"I don't know," Brandon said honestly. "She was drugged. Disoriented. Scared. If you'd called immediately, paramedics could have treated her. Police could have set up protection. Marcus might not have been able to get to her."

"So I could have saved her," Dale said. His voice was barely a whisper.

"Maybe," Brandon said. "But maybe not. Marcus was a deputy sheriff. He had access to the investigation. He knew where you lived. If he'd wanted to get to Sarah badly enough, he might have found a way regardless. You might even have triggered him into acting sooner and killing both of you."

"But I gave him the opportunity," Dale said. "By not calling. By trying to handle it myself."

"Yes," Brandon said. There was no point in lying. "You gave him the opportunity. And that was wrong. But Dale—Marcus is the one who killed her. Not you. He strangled her. He took her life. That's on him, not you."

Dale put his head in his hands. His shoulders shook.

Hicks put a hand on his client's shoulder. "Dale, if you're ready, we should sign the plea agreement."

Dale nodded without looking up. Hicks pulled out a pen and set the papers in front of Dale. After a moment, Dale lifted his head, wiped his eyes, and signed.

His hand shook with every letter.

---

Outside, walking back to the car, Matt was quiet. Brandon knew that look. His partner was processing, thinking through implications.

"You think he'll hold up at trial?" Matt asked once they were in the car.

"I think so," Brandon said. "He wants to do the right thing. Finally."

"Defense is going to tear him apart."

"Probably. But his testimony corroborates Marcus's confession. And they have physical evidence—the box, the name changes, witness statements. Even if Dale falls apart on the stand, they have enough."

Matt started the engine but didn't put the car in gear. "That question he asked. About whether he could have saved her."

"Yeah."

"You think he could have?"

Brandon looked out the window at the gray sky. "Honestly? I don't know. If he'd called 911 immediately, if he'd told the truth about finding her—maybe. But Marcus was desperate. Obsessed. He'd been planning this for years. Even if Dale had done everything right, Marcus might have found another way."

"But we'll never know."

"No. We'll never know." Brandon turned to look at Matt. "That's what Dale has to live with. Not just what he did do, but what he didn't do. The call he didn't make. The choice that might have changed everything."

Matt was quiet for a moment. Then he put the car in reverse and backed out of the parking spot.

"Where to now?" he asked.

Brandon checked his watch. Ten-thirty. "Linda Carpenter. We should tell her about the plea deal before she hears it from the prosecutor."

Matt nodded and headed toward the highway. Neither of them spoke for several miles.

Then Matt said, "That thing you told Dale. About Marcus being responsible, not him. You believe that?"

"Yes," Brandon said. "Dale made unfortunate choices. But Marcus is the killer. There's a difference between enabling something and causing it."

"But Dale feels responsible anyway."

"Of course he does." Brandon watched the farmland roll past. "That's the thing about guilt. It doesn't care about logic or proportional responsibility. It just sits there, heavy, reminding you of what you could have done differently."

Matt glanced at him. "You speaking from experience?"

Brandon thought about Missouri. About being ten years old and feeling like he should have known something, should have seen something, should have saved someone he loved. About twenty-one years of carrying that weight.

"Yeah," he said quietly. "I guess I am."

They drove the rest of the way to Thorndale in comfortable silence.

-----

Linda Carpenter’s house looked different in November. The flower beds that had been mulched in October were now covered with a light dusting of frost. The American flag on the porch hung limp in the still air. A wreath on the front door—simple, understated, the kind you’d see at a funeral home.

Brandon noticed these things as Matt parked on the street. Small changes that marked time passing. Six months since Sarah disappeared. One week since they’d found her body. Three days since Marcus Kowalski had confessed to killing her.

“You want to take the lead on this one?” Brandon asked.

Matt shook his head. “You’re better with families.”

I'm not sure that's true.” Brandon looked at his partner. “You know how to relate to people. I just tell them the truth.”  

“The truth is what she needs,” Matt said. But he didn’t move to get out of the car.

Brandon understood the hesitation. This was the hardest part of the job. Not the investigation, not the interrogation, not even the arrest. It was this—sitting across from a mother and telling her how her daughter died. Knowing that every word would be something she’d replay in her mind for the rest of her life.

“We could call Dunham,” Matt said. “Have him do this.”

“We could,” Brandon agreed. “But we’re the ones who solved it. We’re the ones who got the confession. She deserves to hear it from us.”

Matt nodded. They got out of the car.

The front door opened before they reached the porch. Linda stood in the doorway wearing jeans and a sweatshirt, her hair pulled back. She looked older than she had two weeks ago. Thinner. Hollowed out.

“Agents,” she said. Her voice was steady but flat. “I’ve been expecting you.”

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Matt said. “Thank you for seeing us. May we come in?”

She stepped aside. They entered the living room—the same room they’d sat in before, surrounded by photos of Sarah. But now there was something new on the coffee table. A framed photo of Sarah from high school, surrounded by candles. A memorial.

“Would you like coffee?” Linda asked.

“We’re fine, thank you,” Matt said.

They sat on the couch. Linda took the armchair across from them, her hands folded in her lap. Waiting.

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Matt started, “we wanted to update you personally on the status of the investigation. The prosecutor’s office will be reaching out formally, but we thought you should hear it from us first.”

“You arrested someone,” Linda said. “The news said it was a deputy sheriff. Miles Kowalski.”

“Yes ma’am,” Matt said. “His real name is Marcus Harding. He was Dale Kovacs’s stepson. He lived with Dale just outside Thorndale from age twelve to twenty-one.”

Linda’s expression didn’t change. Like she’d already processed this information, already accepted it. “The boy who made Sarah uncomfortable at church.”

“Yes,” Brandon said. “Marcus developed an obsession with Sarah when they were both young. It never went away. When he became a deputy sheriff and returned to the area, he started watching her again.”

“And he killed her,” Linda said. Still flat. Still emotionless.

“Yes,” Matt said. “He confessed three days ago. Gave us details about what happened. We wanted to come tell you in person, and to answer any questions you might have.”

Linda was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was very small. “Did she suffer?”

Brandon had been dreading this question. But he’d known it was coming.

“She was afraid,” he said gently. “Marcus took her from the Crossroads and brought her to Dale’s barn. He’d drugged her—she wasn’t fully conscious for the beginning of it. When she woke up, she was confused. Disoriented.” 

“But did she suffer?” Linda asked again. Her eyes were fixed on Brandon’s face.

Brandon thought about the impression from the barn. The terror. The desperate clawing at the dirt. The single word: *why*.

“Yes,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Carpenter. Yes, she suffered.”

Linda’s hands tightened in her lap. A single tear rolled down her cheek, but her expression didn’t change.

“How long?” she asked. “How long before—before she died?”

“Marcus kept her in the barn initially, then Dale found her and moved her to his house,” Matt said. “She was there for three days. Then Marcus came back and took her to the barn again. That’s when—” He stopped.

“That’s when he killed her,” Linda finished.

“Yes ma’am.”

“Was it quick?”

Brandon and Matt exchanged a glance. This was the question victims’ families always asked. And the answer was never what they wanted to hear.

“He strangled her,” Brandon said. “It would have taken a few minutes.”

Linda closed her eyes. More tears now, streaming down her face. But still quiet. Still controlled.

“Why?” she asked. “Why Sarah? She was just a girl working at a library. She wasn’t hurting anyone. Why did he—” Her voice broke.

“Because he believed she was the only person in the world who understood him,” Brandon said. “He’d built up a fantasy in his mind over thirteen years. About how they had this special connection. How he was supposed to protect her. When that fantasy shattered—when Sarah didn’t see him the way he saw her—he couldn’t accept it.”

“So he killed her,” Linda said.

“Yes.”

“Because she didn’t love him back.”

“Yes.”

Linda opened her eyes. “That’s not a reason. That’s not—that doesn’t make any sense.”

“It doesn’t,” Matt agreed. “People like Marcus—they build these narratives to justify their actions. To him, he was protecting her. Even when he was killing her.”

“He told her he loved her,” Brandon said quietly. “While his hands were around her throat.”

Linda’s face crumpled. “Oh god. Oh god, my baby.”

Matt leaned forward. “Mrs. Carpenter, I know this is incredibly difficult. But I need you to know—Sarah fought. She didn’t give up. Even in those final moments, she was trying to leave evidence. Trying to make sure someone would know what happened to her.”

“The bracelet,” Linda said through her tears. “The news said you found her bracelet.”

“Yes,” Brandon said. “She pulled it off and buried it where Marcus couldn’t see. So we’d know she’d been there.”

“That’s my Sarah,” Linda whispered. “Always thinking. Always smart.”

They sat in silence for a moment. Linda crying quietly. Matt and Brandon waiting.

Finally Linda wiped her eyes. “What happens now?”

“Marcus is being held without bail,” Matt said. “His trial is scheduled for March. Dale Kovacs has agreed to testify about what he knows. The prosecutor is confident they’ll get a conviction.”

“And Dale?” Linda asked. “What about him?”

“He’s taking a plea deal,” Matt said. “Five years for kidnapping, obstruction, and improper disposal of remains. He cooperated fully with the investigation.”

“Five years,” Linda said. “My daughter is dead and he gets five years.”

“I know it doesn’t seem fair—”

“It’s not fair,” Linda interrupted. Her voice was stronger now. Angry. “He kept her in his house for three days. He buried her body. He let Marcus get away with it for six months. And he gets five years.”

“You’re right,” Brandon said. “It’s not fair. But without Dale’s cooperation, we might not have caught Marcus. The physical evidence alone wasn’t enough. We needed Dale’s testimony.”

Linda shook her head. “I know. I know you did your jobs. I know you did everything you could. But it’s not fair.”

“No,” Brandon agreed. “It’s not.”

They sat for another moment. Then Linda stood. “I need—I need to be alone now. I’m sorry.”

Matt and Brandon stood as well. “Of course,” Matt said. “We’ll go. But Mrs. Carpenter—if you have any other questions, any time, you can call us. Day or night.”

He handed her his card. Linda took it without looking at it.

“The coroner’s office will be in touch about Sarah’s remains,” Matt continued. “They’ve been released. You can make arrangements whenever you’re ready.”

Linda nodded. “They called this morning. The funeral will early next-Monday or Tuesday. At Thorndale Community Church. Two o’clock.”

“We’ll be there if you’d like us to be,” Matt said.

“No.” Linda’s voice was quiet but firm. “No, I don’t think that would be appropriate. This is for family. For people who knew her. Who loved her.”

Brandon understood. They were the investigators. The ones who’d brought closure. But they weren’t mourners. They didn’t belong at Sarah’s funeral.

“We understand,” he said.

Linda walked them to the door. As Brandon stepped onto the porch, he glanced back. Linda was standing in the doorway, one hand on the frame, looking small and broken.

On the table behind her, Brandon could see Sarah’s library badge sitting next to the memorial photo. A small laminated rectangle with her smiling face. The badge she’d worn every day at work. The badge that had been found in her car six months ago.

Linda was keeping it close. A piece of the daughter she’d never see again.

“Mrs. Carpenter,” Brandon said, turning back. “Sarah was brave. In those final moments. I need you to know that.”

Linda looked at him. “How do you know?”

“I just do,” Brandon said.

She held his gaze for a long moment. Then nodded. “Thank you.”

She closed the door.

Matt and Brandon walked back to the car in silence. Once they were inside, Matt let out a long breath.

“Jesus,” he said.

“Yeah.”

They sat for a moment, neither moving to start the car.

“You know what the worst part is?” Matt said finally.

“What?”

“We gave her answers. We told her exactly what happened to her daughter. And it didn’t help. She’s not any less broken than she was before.”

“No,” Brandon agreed. “She’s not. Because answers aren’t closure. They’re just… information. The grief doesn’t go away. It just gets a story attached to it.”

Matt started the engine. “One more stop. Dunham.”

“Yeah.”

As they pulled away from Linda Carpenter’s house, Brandon looked back one more time. The wreath on the door. The frost on the flower beds. The house where a mother would spend the rest of her life missing her daughter.

Some wounds never healed.

You just learned to live with them.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

-----

The Parke County Sheriff’s Office was quiet when they arrived just after one PM. Most of the deputies were out on patrol or at lunch. The dispatcher at the front desk recognized them and waved them through.

They found Dunham in his office, staring at his computer screen. He looked up when they knocked, and Brandon saw the exhaustion in his face. The man had aged a decade in the past week.

“Ellis. Gray.” Dunham gestured to the chairs across from his desk. “Come in. Close the door.”

They sat. Brandon noticed the file folders stacked on Dunham’s desk—personnel records, incident reports, years of documentation. Dunham caught him looking.

“Background checks,” Dunham said. “Every deputy we’ve hired in the past five years. Going through them all again. Making sure we didn’t miss anything else.”

“You won’t find anything,” Matt said. “Kowalski was clean. His background check was thorough. There was nothing to find.”

“Marcus Harding,” Dunham corrected. “That’s who I hired. Marcus Harding pretending to be Miles Kowalski. And I didn’t catch it.”

“The name change was legal,” Brandon said. “It wouldn’t have shown up unless you specifically searched for prior names. Which no one does for standard background checks.”

“I still should have noticed something in the 2 years i supervised him,” Dunham said. “I just can't believe i missed it.”

“Because he was good at hiding,” Matt said. “He’d been practicing since he was a teenager. The mask he wore—that wasn’t new. That was years of refinement.”

Dunham picked up a photo from his desk. Brandon recognized it—the department’s staff photo from last year. Dunham, Kowalski, and the rest of the deputies standing in front of the courthouse.

“Look at him,” Dunham said, pointing to Kowalski in the photo. “He looks normal. Happy. Like any other deputy just doing his job.”

“He was doing his job,” Brandon said. “That’s what made him dangerous. He was functional. Competent. He blended in perfectly because he’d learned how to mimic normalcy.”

“But there had to be signs,” Dunham insisted. “Something I should have seen. Some behavior, some comment, something that should have tipped me off.”

Matt leaned forward. “Tom, I’ve been doing this for over fifteen years. I’ve investigated dozens of homicides. And I can tell you—people like Marcus don’t show obvious signs. They’re not walking around with red flags. They compartmentalize. The Marcus who showed up to work was different from the Marcus who was obsessed with Sarah Carpenter. Two separate people in the same body.”

“Agent Gray,” Dunham said, looking at Brandon. “You figured it out. You knew Marcus was right for this. What did you see that I didn’t?”

Brandon chose his words carefully. “I didn’t see it in him. I saw it in the case. The way the investigation was handled, the evidence that was collected—or wasn’t collected. The fact that the first officer on scene was also someone who’d been visiting the library where Sarah worked. Those patterns pointed to someone with access and knowledge.”

“But if you’d worked with him every day,” Dunham pressed, “would you have known? Would you have seen it?”

Brandon thought about that. About all the times he’d stood next to someone who was hiding something. About how good people could be at concealing their true nature.

“Probably not,” Brandon admitted. “Not unless I was specifically looking for it. And even then—Marcus was careful. He’d been careful his entire adult life.”

Dunham set the photo down. “The mayor wants a press conference. Wants me to explain how this happened. How a deputy sheriff in my department murdered a young woman and investigated his own crime for six months.”

“What are you going to tell them?” Matt asked.

“The truth. That Marcus Harding changed his name, had no criminal record, passed a background check, and became a deputy sheriff. That he hid his obsession with Sarah Carpenter. That when we reopened the case as a cold case, he volunteered to help because he wanted to stay close to the investigation. And that he was caught because two FBI agents saw patterns we missed.” Dunham looked between them. “That about cover it?”

“Sounds right,” Matt said.

They sat in silence for a moment. Brandon could hear the dispatcher talking on the radio in the front office. A deputy calling in a traffic stop on Route 36.

“Your department will survive this,” Matt said. “It’ll be hard. The media will be brutal. Public trust will take a hit. But you’ll get through it.”

“Will we?” Dunham asked. “Because I’m not sure. Kowalski was one of us. Wore the same uniform. Took the same oath. And he used that access to murder someone. How do we come back from that?”

“By doing the job,” Brandon said. “By being transparent about what happened and what you’re doing to prevent it from happening again. By showing the community that one bad deputy doesn’t define the entire department.”

Dunham nodded, but he didn’t look convinced.

“Tom,” Matt said. "The sheriff called us when Sarah’s case went cold. You asked for help. You gave us full access to your files, your deputies, your investigation. You didn’t try to cover anything up or protect your own. That matters.”

“Does it?” Dunham asked. “Because from where I’m sitting, it looks like I brought in the FBI to clean up a mess I should have prevented.”

“You couldn’t have prevented this,” Brandon said firmly. “Marcus was going to fixate on Sarah regardless of what you did or didn’t do. The obsession started when he was seventeen. Long before you hired him. Long before he became a cop. You’re not responsible for what he did.”

“But I am responsible for not seeing it,” Dunham said.

“No,” Brandon said. “You’re responsible for doing your job. Which you did. You investigated thoroughly. You called for help when you needed it. And when we identified Marcus as the killer, you supported the arrest without hesitation. That’s what you’re responsible for. The rest—that’s on Marcus.”

Dunham was quiet for a long moment. Then he pulled open his desk drawer and took out a business card. He slid it across the desk to Matt.

“If another case comes up,” Dunham said. “Something we can’t handle. You’ll come back?”

Matt picked up the card. “You have our direct numbers. Call anytime.”

“I mean it,” Dunham said. “You two—you’re good at this. You see things we miss. I’d rather call you in early than wait until it’s too late.”

“We appreciate that,” Matt said.

Brandon stood. “Chief Deputy, you’re going to second-guess yourself for a while. That’s normal. But eventually you’ll realize you did everything you could with the information you had. And that’s all anyone can do.”

Dunham stood as well. “How long does that take? The not second-guessing yourself part?”

Brandon thought about Missouri. About twenty-one years of wondering if he could have done something different. “I’ll let you know when I figure it out.”

They shook hands. Dunham’s grip was firm despite the exhaustion in his face.

“Thank you,” Dunham said. “For solving this. For bringing Sarah home. For—for everything.”

“It’s the job,” Matt said.

“No,” Dunham said. “It’s more than that. And you know it.”

# Epilogue

The Indianapolis FBI field office occupied the fourteenth floor of a glass and steel tower on Pennsylvania Street. Thursday afternoon sunlight cut through the windows, casting long shadows across rows of cubicles where analysts worked phones and computers, building cases one detail at a time.

Brandon Gray sat at a borrowed desk, typing the final paragraphs of his report. Three days of work condensed into official language: victim profile, suspect identification, interview methodology, confession obtained. The words looked sterile on the screen, stripped of the weight they carried. Nothing about standing in Dale Kovacs's barn feeling Sarah Carpenter's final moments. Nothing about watching Marcus Kowalski's mask shatter when confronted with impossible knowledge.

Just facts. Evidence. Procedure.

Matt Ellis stood at the printer, collecting the last pages of his own report. He'd written his account separately—his observations, his interview notes, his assessment of the confession's validity. Between them, the two documents told the complete story of how Sarah Carpenter's case was solved.

"Almost done?" Matt asked, walking over with the printed pages.

"Last paragraph." Brandon hit a few more keys, then stopped. Stared at the cursor blinking on the screen.

Matt recognized that look. "What is it?"

"Nothing. Just thinking about Missouri."

Matt set the papers down and leaned against the desk. They'd had this conversation three days ago, after Marcus's confession. But he sensed Brandon needed to say something more.

"Twenty-one years," Brandon said quietly. "My brother's still looking for her. Still checking databases, following up on Jane Does, calling sheriffs in counties across three states. He can't let it go."

"And you?"

Brandon closed the laptop. "I used to think I'd solve it someday. That whatever this ability is, I'd take it back to Ashford and finally see what happened that night. Finally give my brother answers."

"But you don't think that anymore."

"No." Brandon stood and walked to the window. Fourteen floors below, Indianapolis traffic moved in steady streams. People going home, going to dinner, going about their lives. "Some cases don't have answers. Some people disappear and never get found. And you can spend your whole life chasing ghosts, or you can—"

He stopped. Matt waited.

"Or you can use what you learned from that loss to help someone else," Brandon finished. "Sarah Carpenter got answers. Linda Carpenter got to bury her daughter. That matters. That has to be enough."

"It is enough," Matt said.

Brandon turned from the window. "Yeah. I think it is."

They stood in silence for a moment. Then Matt checked his watch. "We should brief the SAC before we leave. He'll want the highlights."

They walked down the hallway to the corner office where Special Agent in Charge Robert Chen sat behind a desk covered with case files. He looked up when they knocked, waved them in.

"Ellis. Gray. Heard you closed the Carpenter case. Good work."

"Thank you, sir," Matt said. They both remained standing. This wasn't a long conversation.

"Confession hold up?"

"Solid. Recorded, witnessed, voluntary. He waived counsel. Defense will try to suppress it, but they won't succeed."

Chen nodded. "Prosecutor's office happy?"

"Very. They're expecting a conviction."

"Good. Media's been all over it. Deputy sheriff killing the woman he was supposed to protect—that's the kind of story that gets traction." Chen leaned back in his chair. "You two are getting a commendation. Should come through next month."

"Appreciated," Matt said.

Chen pulled a folder from the stack on his desk. "Since you're here, I've got something for you. Your next assignment."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a glance. They'd expected a few days off, time to decompress before the next case.

"I know you just finished," Chen said, reading their expressions. "But this one's time-sensitive. Missing college student in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Twenty-year-old woman, disappeared five days ago from her apartment. Local PD thinks it's an abduction, but they're not making progress. Family's connected—father's a state senator—so there's political pressure to solve it fast."

Matt took the folder. Opened it. A photo of a young woman smiled up at him from what looked like a family portrait. Dark hair, bright eyes, whole life ahead of her.

"Why us?" Brandon asked.

"Because Cedar Rapids PD requested federal assistance, and because you two have a track record with missing persons cases." Chen folded his hands on the desk. "Also because the circumstances are unusual. No sign of forced entry. No indication of a struggle. Her car's in the parking lot, her purse is in her apartment, her phone is on her nightstand. But she's gone."

"Sounds like she left voluntarily," Matt said, still reading the file.

"That's what the locals thought at first. But her bank accounts haven't been touched. No activity on her credit cards. And according to her roommate, she had an exam the next morning—wasn't the type to just take off."

Brandon looked at the photo again. Something about the case felt familiar. Not the specifics, but the pattern. A young woman who disappeared without obvious explanation. A family desperate for answers.

"When do you want us in Cedar Rapids?" Matt asked.

"Tonight if possible. Tomorrow morning at the latest." Chen stood. "The father—Senator Reeves—he's been calling twice a day. Wants to know what we're doing to find his daughter. I need to tell him we've got our best people on it."

Matt closed the folder. "We'll head out tonight."

After they left Chen's office, they walked back to the borrowed desk where Brandon had been working. His laptop sat closed, his few personal items already packed in a messenger bag. Ready to move on.

"You good with this?" Matt asked. "We could push back, take a few days."

"No. Let's go." Brandon picked up the bag. "That girl's been missing five days. If something happened to her, every hour matters."

"And if she left on her own?"

"Then we figure that out and bring her home." Brandon looked at the case file in Matt's hands. "Either way, her family deserves to know."

They gathered the rest of their materials, submitted their reports to the administrative assistant, and headed for the elevator. The field office continued its work around them—phones ringing, printers humming, the steady machinery of federal law enforcement grinding through cases and evidence and the endless pursuit of truth.

In the elevator, Matt opened the file again and skimmed the details. "Cedar Rapids is about six hours northwest. We can make it by nine if we leave now."

"You want to drive tonight or fly out tomorrow morning?"

"Drive. I want to hit the ground running." Matt looked at the photo of the missing woman again. "Her name's Emily Reeves. Sophomore at Coe College. English major. Worked part-time at a bookstore downtown. By all accounts, a good kid."

"They always are," Brandon said quietly.

The elevator opened on the ground floor. They walked through the lobby and out into the late afternoon cold. The parking garage was two blocks away. They walked in silence, both of them already shifting mental gears from the Carpenter case to whatever waited for them in Cedar Rapids.

Matt's car was on the third level. A dark blue sedan, government issue, anonymous and practical. They loaded their bags in the trunk. Matt got behind the wheel. Brandon took the passenger seat.

For a moment, neither of them moved to leave.

"You ever wonder if we make a difference?" Matt asked. His hands rested on the steering wheel, eyes forward. "Real difference, I mean. We solve cases, catch killers. But the people are still dead. The families are still broken. Does it actually change anything?"

Brandon thought about Linda Carpenter's face when they'd told her how Sarah died. The pain there. The grief. The answers that didn't bring comfort but did bring truth.

"I don't know if we change anything," Brandon said. "But we give people truth. And sometimes truth is all they have left."

He thought about Missouri again. About his brother still searching after twenty-one years. About the answers that never came and the weight of not knowing.

"Sarah Carpenter's mother got to bury her daughter," Brandon continued. "She knows what happened. She knows Sarah fought. She knows her daughter tried to leave evidence so someone would find her. That's not nothing, Matt. That's something."

Matt nodded slowly. "Yeah. I guess it is."

He started the engine. The sedan rumbled to life, ready for another drive, another case, another family waiting for answers.

"Cedar Rapids," Matt said, pulling out of the parking space. "Six hours. We should make it before the office closes if we push."

"You want me to drive part of it?"

"We'll see how I'm feeling around Indianapolis. Might take you up on that."

They descended through the parking garage levels, past rows of cars belonging to people working normal jobs with normal hours. Out onto Pennsylvania Street, merging into evening traffic. The city moved around them—people heading home, lights coming on in office windows, the ordinary rhythm of a Thursday evening.

But for Matt Ellis and Brandon Gray, Thursday evening meant the beginning of something else. Another missing person. Another family in crisis. Another chance to use what they knew, what they'd learned, what Brandon could sense in ways neither of them fully understood.

The highway stretched ahead, leading northwest toward Iowa and whatever waited for them there. A college student who'd disappeared without explanation. A senator's daughter. A roommate with questions. A college town holding its breath.

Matt merged onto I-65, the city falling away behind them. Brandon pulled out the case file and started reading in the fading light. Making mental notes. Building a framework for what they'd need to do when they arrived.

"What are you thinking?" Matt asked after a few miles.

"That it could be anything. Voluntary disappearance, abduction, something in between." Brandon closed the file. "But something about it feels wrong."

"Wrong how?"

"I don't know yet. Just—off. The way she left everything behind. Phone, purse, car. If you're running away, you take those things. If someone takes you against your will, there's usually signs of struggle."

"Unless she knew the person," Matt said. "Went with them willingly."

"Maybe." Brandon looked out at the darkening farmland. "We'll know more when we get there."

They drove on as the sun dropped below the horizon and the highway lights began to flicker on. Behind them, Indianapolis faded into the distance. Ahead, somewhere in the Iowa darkness, Emily Reeves was missing. Waiting to be found. Or waiting to be understood.

Matt and Brandon would do what they always did. They'd investigate. They'd interview. They'd look at the evidence and the patterns and the people until the truth revealed itself.

And if they were lucky—if Brandon's ability cooperated, if the evidence was there, if they asked the right questions—they'd bring Emily home. Or at least bring her family answers.

It was the job. The only job that had ever made sense to either of them.

The highway stretched ahead, endless in the night. Another case. Another town. Another chance to make a difference, however small.

Matt settled in for the drive. Brandon closed his eyes, already thinking about Cedar Rapids. About a bookstore and a college campus and an apartment where a young woman had disappeared.

The work continued. It always did.

And for now, that was enough.
