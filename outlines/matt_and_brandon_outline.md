# First Novella Structure

## Act 1: The Setup (Chapters 1-3)

* Open with Billy and David arriving at a new case
Show Billy's "process" but keep it mysterious - he examines scenes alone, takes hours, emerges exhausted

* Establish that Billy never explains his methods, just provides leads

* Make this case particularly difficult/disturbing - maybe a child victim, maybe the Unsolved Mysteries case you're basing it on is especially haunting

## Act 2: The Investigation (Chapters 4-7)

* Billy provides increasingly specific details that make David (and readers) question how he knows
* The psychological toll on Billy becomes more visible - he's not sleeping, drinking more, avoiding talking about it
    * No on the drinking! I'm firm on that. We could do the reduced sleep. However, I have this idea that Billy could be a neurodivergent character who doesn't pay a "traditional" psychological toll. He's able to remain semi-detached from the horrors of what he witnesses and it manifests physically as an almost obsessive emphasis on cases. I also want to have a case that he's personally invested in that he's been unable to solve as a part of his over-arching story across all stories. The UM case I have in mind for that over-arching mystery is the Angela Hammond case.
* Maybe a scene where someone asks "Did you see it happen?" and Billy deflects
    * Maybe, but this could be a bit too "on the nose" if not handled well.
* The case gets personal - maybe Billy identifies with the victim or is haunted by something specific about this crime
    * See my previous note about the over-arching case. I think that the case in the first novella should mirror the case he's personally invested in some way. I don't want it to be close enough to be the same perpetrator because that would ruin the over-arching case being used across all the stories. I just want the current case to mirror that one enough to haunt him and for us to use that as a springboard to introduce th eover-arching case.

## Act 3: The Reveal & Resolution (Chapters 8-10)

* The reveal of Billy's true ability happens organically through the case needs or emotional breakdown
    * Yes, what I have in mind for the reveal is that Billy and David have to help with interrogation of the suspect. And through that assistance it becomes clear Billy knows more than he could have gleaned just from the crime scene. Should Billy actually be involved in questioning the suspect or should he give information to the LEOs questioning him? A direct confrontation with the perp is more emotionally charged, but not as realistic. Unless we maybe make Billy and David both FBI agents? Agents whose job it is to specifically consult with local PDs on major cases. Something to think about.
* This changes David's understanding of everything they've done together
    * Initially I wanted David to already know what Billy's ability is, but I think having David in the dark for the first book will be good. Because the full explanation of the reveal can be done through dialoge rather than exposition.
* The case resolves but we understand the true cost of what Billy does
* End with them heading to the next case, but now WE know what Billy will experience

## Key Questions

* What's the Unsolved Mysteries case you want to base the first novella on? That will shape everything. The more emotionally devastating and psychologically complex the real case, the better foundation you have.
    * I'm open to feedback on that. The current intro is based on the Kristin Smart case. I don't know if there's enough meat there to use that one. But, I think that it could be a good one because the missing young woman angle would mirror Angela Hammond. Also, it was complex in real life and took many years to bring the killer to justice.

* Do you want Billy's ability to be "known" to anyone at the start? Does David know? Does the FBI know? Or is Billy lying to everyone, even his partner?
    * I initially thought David would already know. Maybe he already suspects something more is at play, but doesn't have confirmation until the reveal at the end of book 1.

* What are your thoughts on the reveal timing and mechanism?
    * I think I made a note about this above. I think it should come up organically because of his knowledge of the case. Whether that is through a direct confrontation with the perp or through a conversation with David over his knowledge is still unknown. That's a detail we'll probably unearth when we get to that point in the story.

## Additional Thoughts

* I think we might need better names for the MCs. I have Billy Branson and David Markowitz, but I'm not sure I like those anymore. Something we should talk about.
    * Billy Branson -> Brandon Gray
    * David Markowitz -> Matt(hew) Ellis
* The idea of Billy being an independent consultant and David his FBI handler was based on a desire to make Billy a pseudo-Jack Reacher-esque character with a psychic rather than physical prowess. But I think that's a mistake. I think there's a better way. Right now, I'm leaning most heavily toward having them both be FBI agents on a special "cold case" assignment to aid other departments due to Billy's success in that work. I feel like we eventually need to explain how they got there, but not in the first book.
* I think we should do POV chapters, switching between David and Billy. To make this effective, we'll need to do some fairly detailed character sketching. High level, I consider David to be a fairly straight-laced by-the-book investigator. He sees solving crimes as an intellectual puzzle. Billy, on the other hand, is a more emotional, psychology focused investigator. In addition to his ability to witness crimes, he should be good at analyzing people and understanding their motiviations and underlying psychopathology. In short, David builds cases using the clues as building blocks, Billy uses his witnessing of the crime and his deep understanding of people.
* Is 10 chapters the right amount? Probably. I don't want these stories to drag on. I want them to be stories that readers can knock out quickly. Like a deeper, psychological focused version of old pulp crime novels. Although I never want the contents to feel pulpy.
