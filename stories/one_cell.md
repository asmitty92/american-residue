# One Cell

## One

The phone woke Jeff at 5:47 in the morning.

He reached for it in the dark, knocking over the glass of water on his nightstand. The cold splash barely registered as he squinted at the screen. The number wasn't saved in his contacts, but he recognized the area code. Their old neighborhood.

"Hello?"

"Jeff." The voice came through rough, like gravel sliding down a slope. "It's Josh."

Jeff sat up. His brother's name hit him harder than the water soaking into the sheets. He couldn't remember the last time they'd spoken. Five years? Six?

"Josh," he said.

"Yeah." A pause. Background noise filtered through the line—traffic, maybe, or wind. "I know it's early."

"It's fine. Are you okay?"

"I've been thinking about some things." Josh's voice carried something Jeff couldn't quite identify. Not fear exactly. Resignation, maybe. "I wanted to call before—" He stopped. "I wanted you to know I don't blame you."

"Blame me for what?"

"For Mom sending me to live with Uncle Tommy. I know you didn't have anything to do with that. She made that call on her own."

Jeff's throat tightened. "Josh, that was twenty-five years ago."

"I know." Another pause. "But I wanted you to know anyway. You were a good brother. The best brother. You always protected me when we were kids."

"You don't need to—"

"I've been thinking a lot lately about the one cell," Josh said. His words came faster now, tumbling over each other. "You remember? How Ms. Peterson told us that identical twins come from one cell that splits? I've been thinking about that. About how we used to be the same thing before......we drifted."

Jeff didn't know what to say. His brother sounded strange. Distant but urgent at the same time.

"Josh, where are you?"

"Doesn't matter." The sound of wind grew louder. "I just wanted you to know that I don't blame you. For any of it. You were always the strong one. I was always the scared one. Until—" He stopped again. "Until I wasn't."

"What's going on? Are you in trouble?"

"Nothing you need to worry about." Josh's voice softened. "Take care of yourself, Jeff. And remember what I said. About the one cell."

"Josh, wait—"

The line went dead.

Jeff sat in the dark holding his phone, water dripping from his nightstand onto the hardwood floor. The room felt colder than it had a few minutes ago. He tried calling back, but it went straight to voicemail. He tried again. Same result.

He got up and walked to the window. Outside, the suburban landscape stretched out in orderly rows of identical houses, each one dark except for the occasional porch light. His neighborhood looked nothing like the one where he and Josh had grown up. He'd worked hard to make sure of that.

The call didn't make sense. Josh sounded like he was saying goodbye, but that was ridiculous. His brother was thirty-eight years old, not some kid making a dramatic gesture. Still, something in his voice had been wrong. Final.

Jeff tried the number again. Voicemail.

He showered and dressed, though it was still before six. His wife, Caroline, slept through the noise. She had a gift for that—sleeping through anything. Their daughter Emma's room was dark as he passed it in the hall. She'd be up in an hour for school.

He made coffee and sat at the kitchen table with his phone in front of him. Every few minutes he picked it up and tried Josh's number again. Nothing.

By seven he was pacing. By eight, when he should have been heading to his engineering firm downtown, he was googling the area code, trying to narrow down where Josh might have been calling from. The old neighborhood. Definitely the old neighborhood.

He hadn't been back there in fifteen years.

Caroline found him at the kitchen table when she came down at eight-thirty. She wore her hospital scrubs—she was a surgical nurse and had a shift starting at ten.

"You're still here," she said.

"Josh called this morning."

She stopped halfway to the coffee maker. "Josh? Your brother Josh?"

"Yeah."

"When was the last time you talked to him?"

"I don't know. Maybe six, seven years ago. Last time he was arrested."

Caroline poured her coffee slowly. They'd been married twelve years and she knew better than to push when he got quiet like this. She waited.

"He called to tell me he doesn't blame me for our mother sending him away," Jeff said. "And he kept talking about this thing we learned in school. About how identical twins come from one cell."

"That's strange."

"He sounded like he was saying goodbye."

Caroline sat down across from him. "Did he say he was going to hurt himself?"

"No. Nothing like that. But something was off." Jeff looked at his phone again. "I keep trying to call back but it goes straight to voicemail."

"Maybe his battery died."

"Maybe."

They sat in silence for a moment. Emma's footsteps creaked overhead as she got ready for school.

"What are you going to do," Caroline asked.

"I don't know. Probably nothing. He's a grown man. If he needed help he'd ask for it."

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn't true. Josh wouldn't ask for help. He never had. Not when they were kids and not now.

Caroline reached across the table and squeezed his hand. "You should at least try to find out if he's okay. You'll worry about it otherwise."

She was right. He would worry. He was already worrying.

"I'll make some calls," he said.

After Caroline and Emma left, Jeff sat alone in the too-quiet house. He didn't know who to call. He didn't have Josh's address. Didn't know where he worked or who his friends were. The only connection he had was Uncle Tommy.

He hadn't spoken to Tommy in even longer than Josh. Not since their mother's funeral eight years ago. Tommy had shown up drunk and left early. Jeff remembered standing by the grave watching his uncle weave his way back to a rusted Cadillac, Josh walking beside him with his hands in his pockets.

Finding Tommy's number took twenty minutes of searching through old contacts and finally calling his cousin Rachel, who still lived in the old neighborhood. She gave him the number and a warning.

"He's not doing great," she said. "The drinking's gotten worse."

"I just need to ask him about Josh."

"Josh is in trouble?"

"I don't know. Maybe. He called me this morning and said some weird things."

Rachel was quiet for a moment. "Be careful, Jeff. That whole world—it's not like when we were kids. It's gotten uglier."

"I'm just making a phone call."

"Sure," she said, but she didn't sound convinced.

Jeff dialed Tommy's number. It rang six times before someone picked up.

"Yeah." The voice was phlegmy and irritated.

"Uncle Tommy? It's Jeff. Jeff Carver."

Silence. Then, "Jesus Christ. What do you want?"

"I'm looking for Josh. He called me this morning and now I can't reach him. I thought you might know where he is."

More silence. Jeff heard Tommy breathing on the other end, wet and labored.

"You don't know," Tommy said finally.

"Don't know what?"

"Josh is dead. Cops found him this morning in an alley off Buchanan Street. Shot twice in the head."

The kitchen tilted. Jeff gripped the edge of the table.

"What?"

"Your brother's dead. They called me an hour ago to identify the body." Tommy's voice was flat, emptied out. "Funeral's probably going to be Friday. I'll text you the details."

"Wait—"

But Tommy had already hung up.

Jeff sat at the table holding his phone. The coffee maker gurgled in the corner. Outside, a neighbor's dog barked. Normal sounds in a normal morning, but nothing felt normal anymore.

Josh had called him at 5:47 to say goodbye.

His brother had known he was going to die.
