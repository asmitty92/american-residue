# Prologue

The Crossroads Mini-Mart sat at the intersection of County Road 400 and State Route 39, three miles south of Thorndale, Indiana. It was the kind of place that survived on lottery tickets, fountain drinks, and the handful of locals who stopped for gas on their way to somewhere else. The building hadn't been updated since the early nineties—faded red brick, a hand-painted sign advertising "Live Bait & Tackle," and a payphone mounted on the exterior wall that hadn't worked in over a decade.

The black sedan pulled into the gravel lot at four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon in October. Two men climbed out. The first, wearing pressed khakis and a navy button-down with the sleeves rolled precisely to mid-forearm, surveyed the property with the systematic attention of someone cataloging details. The second wore khakis that looked like they'd been slept in and a wrinkled gray oxford shirt untucked on one side. He stood by the passenger door for a long moment, staring at the building.

A sheriff's deputy leaned against his cruiser near the entrance, arms crossed. He straightened when he saw them approaching.

"You the FBI?" he asked.

The first man extended his hand. "Agent Ellis. This is Agent Gray."

The deputy shook Ellis's hand, then nodded at Gray, who had moved past them toward the building without acknowledging the introduction. "He always like that?"

"Usually," Ellis said. "You're Deputy...?"

"Kowalski. I was first on scene back in April of last year." He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket and offered it. Ellis declined. "Sheriff said you wanted to see where it happened. Not much to see after eighteen months."

"We appreciate you meeting us." Ellis glanced back at Gray, who stood near the payphone, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as if listening to something. "Can you walk me through what we know?"

Kowalski unwrapped a piece of gum. "Victim was Sarah Carpenter. Twenty-two. Worked at the public library in town. April sixteenth, last year, around eight-fifteen in the evening. She stopped here after her shift." He gestured toward the building. "Witness was Travis Brennan. He was inside getting cigarettes when it happened."

"They knew each other?"

"Small town. Everybody knows everybody. They weren't close, but he recognized her truck in the lot." Kowalski pointed to a spot near the side of the building. "She parked over there. Security camera shows her walking to the payphone. Truck wouldn't start, apparently, and her cell was dead. She called AAA from inside first, then came out to make another call while she waited."

Ellis looked at the payphone. Gray was closer to it now, standing maybe two feet away, still motionless. "The camera caught the abduction?"

"Partial. Camera's mounted above the door, faces the pumps and the front lot. Picks up the edge of where the phone is. We got her walking over, then about three minutes of her on the phone. Then a pickup truck pulls in—older model, dark color, can't make out the plate—and parks between her and the camera. Blocks most of the view."

"But you see something."

"Movement. Looks like someone gets out of the driver's side. Thirty seconds later, the truck pulls out. Heads south on 39. Sarah's gone. Her purse was still by the phone. Keys in her truck."

"What was Brennan doing during this?"

"Inside, like I said. Paying for cigarettes. He comes out maybe a minute after the truck leaves, sees her purse on the ground, no Sarah. Called 911 at eight-nineteen."

Ellis made a note on his phone. "Any leads on the truck?"

"Dark green or dark blue Chevy Silverado, probably mid-to-late nineties. We put out a BOLO, checked every registration in three counties. Found seventeen trucks that matched. Talked to every owner. Nothing stuck."

Gray had moved to the door of the mini-mart. He stood in the entrance, looking back toward where the payphone was mounted on the wall. The angle put the phone about thirty feet from the door, slightly around the corner of the building.

"And no trace of Sarah since?"

"Nothing. No activity on her bank cards, no phone pings, no sightings. It's like she disappeared." Kowalski folded the gum wrapper into a small square. "Sheriff reopened it as a cold case last month. That's when he reached out to you guys."

Ellis thanked him and walked toward the mini-mart. Gray had gone inside. Through the window, Ellis could see him standing near the register, talking to the clerk—a heavyset man in his sixties wearing a Colts jersey.

"That's Marv," Kowalski said, following Ellis's gaze. "Owns the place. He was working that night too."

Inside, the store smelled like stale coffee and air freshener. A radio played country music at low volume. Gray stood with his back to the door, nodding as Marv spoke.

"—told the sheriff the same thing," Marv was saying. "Didn't see nothing. I was stocking the cooler in back when Travis came in. Rang him up, he left. Maybe ninety seconds total. By the time I looked out the window again, that truck was gone."

"You didn't hear anything?" Gray asked. His voice was quiet, even.

"Like what?"

"A scream. A car door. Anything."

Marv shook his head. "Radio was on. And my hearing's not what it used to be."

Gray turned and walked past Ellis without a word, heading back outside. Ellis exchanged a look with Marv—apologetic, professional—and followed.

Outside, the afternoon light was starting to fade. Gray stood by the payphone again. He had taken his hands out of his pockets. His fingers brushed the metal surface of the phone's cradle.

"I need some time here," Gray said when Ellis approached.

"How long?"

"An hour. Maybe two."

Kowalski shifted his weight. "You want me to stick around?"

"No," Gray said. "I work better alone."

The deputy looked to Ellis, who nodded. "We'll call if we need anything. Thanks for your time."

After Kowalski drove off, Ellis walked back to the sedan and leaned against the hood. The sun hung low over the fields to the west, casting long shadows across the gravel lot. Gray stood motionless by the payphone, his hand resting on the receiver. From a distance, it looked like he might be making a call himself.

Ellis checked his watch. Four forty-seven. He pulled out his phone and opened the case file, scrolling through the details again. Witness statements. Security footage stills. The timeline. He'd read it all a dozen times on the drive down from Indianapolis.

When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.

Ellis knew better than to interrupt. He returned to the file, reading the same information he'd already memorized, waiting for whatever it was that Gray did in these moments.

The sun dropped lower. The temperature fell. Ellis grabbed his jacket from the car and put it on.

At six-fifteen, when the sky had gone purple and the security light above the mini-mart door had flickered on, Gray finally stood. He walked back to the car slowly, hands back in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Ellis asked.

Gray opened the passenger door but didn't get in. He stood there, looking back at the payphone.

"She knew him," Gray said.

"The abductor?"

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until it was too late."

Ellis waited, but Gray offered nothing else. He climbed into the car and closed the door.

They drove back to Thorndale in silence as the last light bled from the sky.
