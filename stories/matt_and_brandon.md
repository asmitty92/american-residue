# Prologue
**Wednesday October 22, 2008 4:00PM**

The Crossroads Mini-Mart sat at the intersection of County Road 400 and State Route 39, three miles south of Thorndale, Indiana. It was the kind of place that survived on lottery tickets, fountain drinks, and the handful of locals who stopped for gas on their way to somewhere else. The building hadn't been updated since the early nineties—faded red brick, a hand-painted sign advertising "Live Bait & Tackle," and a payphone mounted on the exterior wall that hadn't worked in over a decade.

The black sedan pulled into the gravel lot at four-thirty on a Wednesday afternoon in October. Two men climbed out. The first, wearing pressed khakis and a navy button-down with the sleeves rolled precisely to mid-forearm, surveyed the property with the systematic attention of someone cataloging details. The second wore khakis that looked like they'd been slept in and a wrinkled gray oxford shirt untucked on one side. He stood by the passenger door for a long moment, staring at the building.

A sheriff's deputy leaned against his cruiser near the entrance, arms crossed. He straightened when he saw them approaching.

"You the FBI?" he asked.

The first man extended his hand. "Agent Ellis. This is Agent Gray."

The deputy shook Ellis's hand, then nodded at Gray, who had moved past them toward the building without acknowledging the introduction. "He always like that?"

"Usually," Ellis said. "You're Deputy...?"

"Kowalski. I was first on scene back in April of last year." He pulled a pack of gum from his pocket and offered it. Ellis declined. "Sheriff said you wanted to see where it happened. Not much to see after eighteen months."

"We appreciate you meeting us." Ellis glanced back at Gray, who stood near the payphone, hands in his pockets, head tilted slightly as if listening to something. "Can you walk me through what we know?"

Kowalski unwrapped a piece of gum. "Victim was Sarah Carpenter. Twenty-two. Worked at the public library in town. April sixteenth, last year, around eight-fifteen in the evening. She stopped here after her shift." He gestured toward the building. "Witness was Travis Brennan. He was inside getting cigarettes when it happened."

"They knew each other?"

"Small town. Everybody knows everybody. They weren't close, but he recognized her car in the lot." Kowalski pointed to a spot near the side of the building. "She parked over there. Security camera shows her walking to the payphone. Car wouldn't start, apparently, and her cell was dead. She called AAA first before going inside to use the restroom, then came out to make another call while she waited."

Ellis looked at the payphone. Gray was closer to it now, standing maybe two feet away, still motionless. "The camera caught the abduction?"

"Partial. Camera's mounted above the door, faces the pumps and the front lot. Picks up the edge of where the phone is. We got her walking over, then about three minutes of her on the phone. Then a pickup truck pulls in—older model, dark color, can't make out the plate—and parks between her and the camera. Blocks most of the view."

"But you see something."

"Movement. Looks like someone gets out of the driver's side. Thirty seconds later, the truck pulls out. Heads south on 39. Sarah's gone. Her purse was still by the phone. Keys in her car."

"What was Brennan doing during this?"

"Inside, like I said. Paying for cigarettes. He comes out maybe a minute after the truck leaves, sees her purse on the ground, no Sarah. Called 911 at eight-nineteen."

Ellis made a note on his phone. "Any leads on the truck?"

"Dark green or dark blue Chevy. Most likely a Silverado, probably mid-to-late nineties. We put out a BOLO, checked every registration in three counties. Found seventeen trucks that matched. Talked to every owner. Nothing stuck."

Gray had moved to the door of the mini-mart. He stood in the entrance, looking back toward where the payphone was mounted on the wall. The angle put the phone about thirty feet from the door, slightly around the corner of the building.

"And no trace of Sarah since?"

"Nothing. No activity on her bank cards, no phone pings, no sightings. It's like she vanished into thin air." Kowalski folded the gum wrapper into a small square. "Sheriff reopened it as a cold case last month. That's when he reached out to you guys."

Ellis thanked him and walked toward the mini-mart. Gray had gone inside. Through the window, Ellis could see him standing near the register, talking to the clerk—a heavyset man in his sixties wearing a Colts jersey.

"That's Marv," Kowalski said, following Ellis's gaze. "Owns the place. He was working that night too."

Inside, the store smelled like stale coffee and air freshener. A radio played country music at low volume. Gray stood with his back to the door, nodding as Marv spoke.

"—told the sheriff the same thing," Marv was saying. "Didn't see nothing. I was stocking the cooler in back when Travis came in. Rang him up, he left. Maybe ninety seconds total. By the time I looked out the window again, that truck was gone."

"You didn't hear anything?" Gray asked. His voice was quiet, even.

"Like what?"

"A scream. A car door. Anything."

Marv shook his head. "Radio was on. And my hearing's not what it used to be."

Gray turned and walked past Ellis without a word, heading back outside. Ellis exchanged a look with Marv—apologetic, professional—and followed.

Outside, the afternoon light was starting to fade. Gray stood by the payphone again. He had taken his hands out of his pockets. His fingers brushed the metal surface of the phone's cradle.

"I need some time here," Gray said when Ellis approached.

"How long?"

"An hour. Maybe two."

Kowalski shifted his weight. "You want me to stick around?"

"No," Gray said. "I work better alone."

The deputy looked to Ellis, who nodded. "We'll call if we need anything. Thanks for your time."

After Kowalski drove off, Ellis walked back to the sedan and leaned against the hood. The sun hung low over the fields to the west, casting long shadows across the gravel lot. Gray stood motionless by the payphone, his hand resting on the receiver. From a distance, it looked like he might be making a call himself.

Ellis checked his watch. Four forty-seven. He pulled out his phone and opened the case file, scrolling through the details again. Witness statements. Security footage stills. The timeline. He'd read it all a dozen times on the drive down from Indianapolis.

When he looked up again, Gray had sat down on the concrete pad beneath the payphone, his back against the wall. His eyes were closed.

Ellis knew better than to interrupt. He returned to the file, reading the same information he'd already memorized, waiting for whatever it was that Gray did in these moments.

The sun dropped lower. The temperature fell. Ellis grabbed his jacket from the car and put it on.

At six-fifteen, when the sky had gone purple and the security light above the mini-mart door had flickered on, Gray finally stood. He walked back to the car slowly, hands back in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

"Well?" Ellis asked.

Gray opened the passenger door but didn't get in. He stood there, looking back at the payphone.

"She knew him," Gray said.

"The abductor?"

"She wasn't afraid at first. Not until it was too late."

Ellis waited, but Gray offered nothing else. He climbed into the car and closed the door.

They drove back to Thorndale in silence as the last light bled from the sky.

# Chapter One
**Wednesday Evening**

The Bluebird Diner sat on the corner of Main and Second in Thorndale, a chrome-sided relic from the fifties with cracked vinyl booths and a rotating pie case by the register. Matt pulled into the gravel parking lot at seven forty-five, following the hand-lettered sign that promised "Home Cooking & Cold Beer." The interior glowed warm yellow through the windows. Only three other cars in the lot—locals, probably, based on the Purdue and Indiana State decals in the back windows.

Brandon was already inside when Matt walked through the door. He'd taken a booth near the back, away from the handful of other customers scattered along the counter. A laminated menu sat untouched in front of him. He stared at the table surface like he was reading something written there.

Matt slid into the opposite side of the booth. "You order yet?"

"No." Brandon looked up. His eyes had that unfocused quality they got after he spent time at a scene. "Waiting for you."

A waitress appeared—sixties, reading glasses on a chain, nametag that said Dottie. She pulled an order pad from her apron. "Coffee?"

"Please," Matt said. "And a Coke for him."

Brandon didn't correct him. Matt had learned his patterns over the past three years. Coffee first thing in the morning and after midnight when they were working late. Coke any other time. Water if he was trying to think through something complicated.

"We got meatloaf tonight," Dottie said. "Comes with mashed potatoes and green beans. Chef's special."

Matt ordered the meatloaf. Brandon asked for a burger, no pickles. Dottie collected the menus and shuffled back toward the kitchen.

"So," Matt said when she was out of earshot. "She knew him."

Brandon nodded. He picked up a sugar packet from the ceramic holder and turned it over in his fingers. "Not well. But familiar enough that she didn't panic when he approached."

"How familiar? Friend? Coworker? Someone she saw around town?"

"Somewhere in that range." Brandon set the sugar packet down. "She was surprised to see him there. That part didn't make sense to her."

Matt pulled out his phone and opened the case file. He'd downloaded everything the sheriff's office had sent over—witness statements, security footage stills, the initial investigation reports. "Kowalski said the camera caught her on the phone for about three minutes before the truck pulled in. Who was she calling?"

"Her mother. Telling her the car broke down and she'd be late getting home." Brandon paused. "AAA said forty-five minutes to an hour for the tow. She wasn't worried. Just annoyed."

Matt scrolled through the file. The phone records confirmed it—one call to AAA at 8:12 PM, lasted two minutes. Second call to a number registered to Linda Carpenter at 8:14 PM, lasted three minutes. Third call placed at 8:17 PM to a number that belonged to someone named Jessica Holt.

"Who's Jessica Holt?"

"Friend from high school. Sarah was calling to see if Jessica could give her a ride home instead of waiting for the tow truck." Brandon's fingers drummed once against the table. "The call went to voicemail. Sarah was leaving a message when the truck arrived."

Matt made a note. "So she's mid-voicemail, not paying full attention. Someone pulls up in a truck. Someone she recognizes. He gets out, walks over. She's not alarmed because she knows him. Then what?"

"Then she realizes something's wrong."

"What makes her realize?"

Brandon was quiet for a moment. His gaze drifted toward the window, where the last of the daylight had faded completely. "The way he was looking at her. The way he moved. She tried to end the call. Dropped the phone."

Dottie returned with their drinks. Matt thanked her. Brandon ignored his Coke.

"So we're looking for someone local," Matt said. "Someone Sarah would recognize on sight. Male. Drives or has access to a dark green or blue Chevy Silverado from the nineties."

"Mid-thirties to early fifties, probably. Based on the truck and the way he moved."

Matt looked up. "You got that from the security footage?"

"Partial. The way he got out of the truck, walked around to the passenger side. Confident but not young. Steady on his feet."

Matt had watched the same footage half a dozen times. The angle was poor, most of the action obscured by the truck itself. He could see movement, shadows, but nothing that told him about the suspect's age or gait. Brandon always saw more. Or claimed to.

"What else?" Matt asked.

"I'm pretty sure this wasn't opportunistic. That he knew she'd be there."

"How could he know that? The car breaking down was random."

Brandon shook his head. "The car didn't break down. He sabotaged it."

Matt set his phone on the table. "That wasn't in any of the reports."

"It wouldn't be. They towed her car to a lot in town, figured they'd deal with it later if Sarah turned up. After a few months they probably sold it for scrap or parts. But the timing's too convenient. Car that's been running fine suddenly won't start right as she's leaving work? He was watching. Waiting for the right moment. He did something to the engine or the battery while she was inside the library."

"That's a big assumption."

"It's the only thing that makes sense." Brandon finally looked at his Coke but didn't drink it. "He knew her routine. Knew she'd stop at the Crossroads for gas on her way home. Knew she'd use the payphone if she didn't have her cell phone."

"Her cell phone?"

"It was missing when they found her purse. It was eventually found at the library but not until a week later. I think he stole it the day she disappeared then went back later and put it back."

Matt leaned back in the booth. Three years working with Brandon Gray, and he still couldn't pin down how his partner assembled these narratives. Sometimes it felt like guesswork elevated to an art form. Other times—most times—it turned out to be uncannily accurate.

"Okay," Matt said. "Let's say you're right. He tampered with her car. Swiped her phone. He's been planning this. Which means he's someone who had access to her car and her phone. Someone close enough to learn her routine."

"Or someone who's been watching her long enough to know it without being close."

"Stalker?"

"Possibly."

Dottie brought their food. The meatloaf came swimming in brown gravy, with real mashed potatoes—not the instant kind—and green beans that still had some snap to them. A basket of rolls arrived with actual butter, not the plastic packets. Brandon's burger was thick and hand-formed, cheese melted perfectly over the edges. The kind of food that justified a small town diner's existence.

"So where do we start?" Matt asked. "Coworkers at the library? Regular customers? Ex-boyfriends?"

"Start with people who drive that truck. Cross-reference with people who knew Sarah well enough to recognize but weren't in her close circle. Friends of friends. Parents of kids she went to school with. That age range."

Matt made notes. "Kowalski said they checked every Silverado owner in three counties. Came up empty."

"They checked registered owners. Someone could be driving their father's truck. Their employer's truck. Borrowed it from a friend." Brandon picked up his burger, examined it, set it back down. "And they were looking for someone with an obvious connection to Sarah. We're looking for someone more peripheral. Someone who'd blend in."

"That's half the town."

"Closer to a quarter. The truck narrows it. So does the age range. And the fact that he's comfortable committing a violent crime in a semi-public location." Brandon finally took a drink of his Coke. "I don't think he's done this before, but he's thought about it a lot. This act...it has meaning to him."

They ate in silence for a while. The diner had emptied out further. Just them and an older couple at the counter nursing coffee. A country song played from a speaker somewhere, too quiet to make out the words.

"This case reminds you of something," Matt said. It wasn't a question.

Brandon looked up. "What makes you say that?"

"The way you're working it. You've been different since we took the call." Matt gestured with his fork. "Usually you're clinical. Going through the steps. This one's getting to you."

Brandon was quiet long enough that Matt thought he might not answer. Then: "There was a case in Missouri. Ashford. Small town like this one. Woman was abducted from a payphone in the center of town. She was on the phone with her boyfriend because he was stuck home babysitting his little brother. He heard her get taken. Rushed out of the house and tried to get there in time."

"When was this?"

"Eighteen years ago. April." Brandon pushed his plate away. Most of the burger was still there. "Never solved. No body. No leads. Just gone."

Matt did the math. Eighteen years put it at 1990. Before he'd joined the Bureau. Before Brandon had, for that matter. "You worked that case?"

"No. I just... heard about it." Brandon's fingers found the sugar packet again. "It stayed with me."

There was something else there. Matt could see it in the way Brandon's jaw tightened, the way he wouldn't quite meet Matt's eyes. But pushing didn't work with Gray. He'd share what he wanted to share when he was ready.

"Similar circumstances don't mean the same perpetrator," Matt said carefully. "Ashford to here is what, six or seven hours?"

"Six and a half." Brandon looked toward the window again. "I know it's not the same guy. Wrong profile. And it was eighteen years ago; the Missouri perp would be too old at this point to be our guy. Plus that case had different markers. Different approach."

"But it reminds you."

"It reminds me that some of them get away with it." Brandon's voice was flat. "That some cases stay cold. That we don't always find them."

Matt watched his partner stare at nothing. In three years, he'd rarely seen Brandon like this—invested in a way that went past professional obligation. Usually Gray approached cases like logic puzzles. Interesting problems to solve, then move on to the next one. This was different. This was personal in a way Matt didn't fully understand.

"We're going to work this one right," Matt said. "Full resources. We'll stay as long as it takes. If there's a solve here, we'll find it."

Brandon nodded but didn't respond.

Dottie brought the check. Matt paid cash and left a twenty percent tip. Outside, the temperature had dropped into the forties. Matt's breath fogged in the air. Brandon stood by the car for a moment, looking back toward the diner like he'd forgotten something.

"You okay?" Matt asked.

"Fine." Brandon got in the passenger seat.

They drove back to the motel—a Quality Inn just off Route 39, the only lodging near Thorndale with more than six rooms. The parking lot was nearly empty. Matt pulled into a spot near their rooms. They'd booked adjoining doubles, doors that connected in case they needed to work late or share files.

"Tomorrow we start with the library," Matt said. "Talk to her coworkers. Get a sense of who came in regularly. Who might have paid attention to her."

"And the truck owners," Brandon added. "I want to see that list from the initial investigation. Verify they actually talked to everyone."

"Agreed."

Brandon got out but didn't head toward his room. He stood in the parking lot, hands in his pockets, looking up at the sky. No moon. No stars visible through the cloud cover.

"What is it?" Matt asked.

"She was twenty-two. Had her whole life ahead of her. Working at the library because she liked being around books. Lived with her mother. Helped with the bills." Brandon's voice was quiet. "She called her mom to say she'd be late. Didn't want her to worry."

Matt didn't know what to say to that. After a moment, Brandon walked to his door, unlocked it, and went inside without another word.

Matt stood alone in the parking lot for a moment longer. The case felt heavier now than it had that morning. He checked his watch. Eight forty-three. Still early. He could review the file again, make notes, prepare for tomorrow's interviews.

Instead, he went to his room, kicked off his shoes, and lay on the bed with the lights off. Through the thin wall, he could hear the faint sound of Brandon moving around next door. A faucet running. The creak of bedsprings. Then silence.

Matt closed his eyes and tried to picture the Crossroads Mini-Mart as it had been eighteen months ago. Sarah Carpenter standing by the payphone, leaving a message for her friend. A truck pulling in. Someone familiar walking toward her. That moment of recognition, then realization. Then nothing.

Somewhere in this town, someone knew what had happened after that. Someone who drove a green or blue Silverado. Someone Sarah had recognized but hadn't been afraid of.

Until it was too late.

Matt's phone buzzed. A text from Brandon: *In case I'm wrong about this being his first time, check missing persons in Indiana and the neighboring states. 2000-present. Specifically with a similar victim profile.*

Matt typed back: *Will do. Get some sleep.*

No response.

Matt set his phone on the nightstand and stared at the ceiling. Tomorrow they'd start building the case. Interviewing witnesses. Running down leads. Doing the work.

But tonight, lying in a motel room in a town he'd never heard of until yesterday, Matt wondered about the things Brandon wasn't saying. About Missouri and payphones and cases that stayed cold.

About why some cases got to you more than others.

# Chapter Two
**Thursday Morning**

Brandon Gray had been awake since four-thirty. Not unusual. Sleep came in fragments on cases like this—two hours, then awake, then another hour if he was lucky. He'd learned to work with it rather than fight it.

By six he was dressed and downstairs in the Quality Inn's breakfast area, a corner room off the lobby with industrial carpet and fluorescent lights that hummed at a frequency most people didn't notice. Brandon noticed. He'd positioned himself at a table in the back corner, away from the windows, with a clear view of the entrance and the coffee station.

The case files were spread across the table in front of him, arranged in a specific order that would look random to anyone else. Witness statements on the left, organized by proximity to the scene. Security footage stills in the center, sequenced by timestamp. Victimology on the right—Sarah Carpenter's life in documents and photographs.

He had a cup of black coffee cooling in front of him. His second. The first he'd made in his room at five-fifteen using the single-serve machine that produced something that tasted like heated dishwater but contained caffeine.

Three other people occupied the breakfast area. An older couple near the waffle maker, talking quietly about their grandson's football game. A man in his forties at a table by the window, reading something on his phone while eating a bagel. The man wore a wedding ring but had a tan line that suggested it was a recent addition. Or a recent return to his finger. Reconciliation, maybe. Or an affair that had ended.

Brandon returned his attention to the files. Sarah Carpenter's face looked up at him from her library ID photo—twenty-two, dark blonde hair pulled back, blue eyes, the kind of smile that made you want to smile back. She'd started at the Thorndale Public Library three years ago, right after community college. Circulation desk, children's programs, whatever needed doing. Her supervisor called her reliable. Her coworker called her sweet. Her mother called her gone.

The phone records showed her last three calls: AAA at 8:12 PM, her mother at 8:14 PM, Jessica Holt at 8:17 PM. The third call had gone to voicemail. The transcript of the recovered message was in the file. *Hey Jess, it's me. My car died at the Crossroads and I'm waiting for a tow but it's going to be like an hour and I'm freezing out here. Any chance you could—*

The message cut off mid-sentence. Not because she'd hung up. Because something had interrupted her.

Someone.

Brandon picked up his coffee. It had gone lukewarm. He drank it anyway.

He thought about the moments before an abduction. The victim's awareness shifting from mundane annoyance to confusion to fear. That transition was usually fast—seconds, not minutes. But Sarah had known her abductor. That changed the timeline. Extended it. She'd had time to realize something was wrong before it was too late to run.

The physiological response to that realization: elevated heart rate, adrenaline spike, pupils dilating, time distortion. Some victims later reported those seconds feeling like minutes. The brain processing threat assessment at accelerated speed. Fight, flight, or freeze.

Sarah had frozen. Or tried to talk her way out. The purse left behind suggested she hadn't run. The lack of defensive wounds—they'd never found her, but the absence of blood at the scene suggested no immediate violence—meant she hadn't fought. She'd gone with him. Maybe thinking she still had a chance to de-escalate. To reason with someone she knew.

She'd been wrong.

Brandon set the coffee down and pulled out his phone. He opened the photos he'd taken yesterday at the Crossroads. The payphone. The angle from the mini-mart door. The spot where Sarah's car had been parked.

He'd stood there for ninety minutes, not moving, barely breathing, letting the scene speak to him the way it always did. Not psychometry. Nothing paranormal. Just attention. Most people looked at crime scenes and saw what was there. Brandon looked at what had been there. The ghost of the event, still present if you knew how to see it.

He'd seen Sarah standing by the phone, receiver to her ear, shifting her weight from foot to foot because it was cold and she was impatient. He'd seen the truck pull in, dark paint catching the security light. He'd seen the driver's door open, someone stepping out. Someone Sarah recognized.

Her body language had changed. Still relaxed, but curious. A small wave, maybe. A question forming.

Then the shift. Subtle at first. Her posture straightening. The hand not holding the phone moving slightly away from her body—unconscious preparation to defend herself or create distance.

But by then it was already too late.

"You're up early."

Brandon looked up. Matt stood by the table, holding a paper plate with a waffle and some fruit. He'd showered and shaved. His shirt was pressed, sleeves rolled evenly. Even at six-thirty in the morning, Matt Ellis looked like an FBI recruitment poster.

"Couldn't sleep," Brandon said.

Matt sat down across from him, surveying the spread of files. "Learn anything new?"

"Sarah was a creature of habit. Same route home every day. Same stop at the Crossroads for gas every Thursday after her shift. She was predictable."

"Which made her easy to watch."

"And easy to intercept." Brandon gathered the files into a stack, his system disrupted now that Matt was there. "If he tampered with her car, he did it while she was inside the library. That's a narrow window. Her shift ended at eight. She left by eight-oh-five according to her coworker. Car was parked in the employee lot behind the building. He would have had maybe ten minutes to disable the starter or drain the battery. Maybe less if he didn't want to be seen."

"So he knew the library's layout. Knew where employees parked."

"Or he'd been watching long enough to learn it." Brandon closed the last file. "We need to talk to her coworkers. See who paid attention to her. Who asked questions."

Matt cut into his waffle. "That's the plan. Library opens at nine. I called ahead—the head librarian said she'd make time for us."

Brandon nodded. He checked his watch. Six forty-three. Two hours and seventeen minutes until the library opened. He could review the files again. Cross-reference the truck registrations with library patron records, see if any names overlapped. Start building a geographic profile of the suspect based on the abduction site and—

"You should eat something," Matt said.

Brandon looked at him.

"You didn't eat much at dinner last night. And you're going to need energy for interviews." Matt gestured toward the breakfast spread. "At least grab a banana or something."

Brandon stood. Matt was right—he often forgot to eat when he was working. His body didn't send the same hunger signals other people seemed to get. He'd go hours without noticing, then feel lightheaded and realize he'd skipped meals.

He walked to the breakfast bar and picked up a banana and a container of yogurt. When he returned to the table, Matt had moved some of the files aside to make room.

They ate in silence for a few minutes. The older couple left, waving goodbye to the front desk clerk. The man by the window remained, still scrolling through his phone. Brandon watched him peripherally. The way he hunched over the screen. The tension in his shoulders. Whatever he was reading wasn't good news.

"You mentioned Missouri last night," Matt said quietly. "Ashford."

Brandon peeled the banana. "Yeah."

"You want to talk about it?"

"Not much to talk about. Unsolved abduction. Eighteen years old."

"Eighteen years is a long time to remember a case you didn't work."

Brandon took a bite of banana. Chewed. Swallowed. "Some cases stick with you."

Matt waited, but Brandon didn't elaborate. After a moment, Matt returned to his waffle. He knew when to push and when to let something sit. It was one of the things that made him a good partner.

Brandon finished the banana and opened the yogurt. Strawberry. Too sweet, but it was calories. He ate it mechanically while thinking about the library. Small town facility, probably built in the early 1900s. Carnegie library if he had to guess, based on the address and the architectural style common to that era. Limited staff. Everyone would know everyone. If someone had been paying unusual attention to Sarah, her coworkers would have noticed.

Unless the person had been careful. Unless they'd blended in so well that their attention seemed normal until it was too late.

"I'm driving today," Brandon said.

Matt looked up. "Yeah?"

"I want to take the route Sarah would have taken. Library to the Crossroads. See what's between."

"Good idea."

They finished breakfast and went back to their rooms to gather their things. Brandon brushed his teeth, checked that his badge and weapon were secure, and grabbed his jacket. The gray oxford shirt from yesterday was wrinkled beyond saving. He'd brought a spare—light blue, still wrinkled but less noticeably. He left it untucked.

At seven-fifteen they met at the car. Brandon took the driver's seat. Matt handed him a travel mug of coffee from the lobby.

"You didn't have to do that," Brandon said.

"I know."

Brandon pulled out of the parking lot and headed north on Route 39 toward downtown Thorndale. The morning was overcast, the sky a uniform gray that suggested rain later. The temperature had dropped overnight. Frost edged the grass along the roadside.

The drive took twelve minutes. Brandon timed it. The library sat on Main Street, a red brick building with white columns and a copper-roofed dome that had turned green with age. A Carnegie library, as he'd suspected. Built 1912 according to the cornerstone.

He parked on the street and sat for a moment, looking at the building. Sarah had worked here. Had climbed these steps every day. Had unlocked the front door, turned on the lights, started the coffee in the break room. Had shelved books and helped patrons and planned children's story time.

Had driven home every Thursday evening, stopping at the Crossroads for gas because it was on her way and the prices were a few cents cheaper than the station in town.

Until one Thursday when her car wouldn't start.

"We've got an hour and a half," Matt said. "Want to walk the route?"

Brandon nodded. They got out of the car and walked around to the back of the library. The employee parking lot was small—six spaces, all empty now. A dumpster sat in the far corner. A security light on a pole, currently off. No cameras visible.

"He could have worked on her car here without being seen," Matt said. "Especially if he did it after dark."

"She worked until eight. It would have been dark by seven-thirty this time of year." Brandon walked to the middle of the lot, turned in a slow circle. Trees lined the back of the property, creating a natural screen from the residential street beyond. "No witnesses. No cameras. If he knew she parked here, this would be the place."

They walked back around to the front. Main Street was starting to wake up—a few cars, some early morning joggers, a woman opening the bakery three doors down. The smell of fresh bread drifted on the cold air.

Brandon and Matt walked south, following the route Sarah would have driven. Past the elementary school. Past the post office. Past the Bluebird Diner where they'd eaten last night. At the edge of town, Main Street became Route 39 again. They stopped at the town limit sign.

"Three miles to the Crossroads from here," Matt said. "Farm fields on both sides. No houses. No businesses. Just road."

Brandon looked south down the empty highway. "Isolated. If he'd taken her somewhere between here and there, no one would have seen."

"But he took her from the Crossroads. In front of a witness, even if that witness was inside."

"Because that's where he knew she'd be stopped. Where she'd be vulnerable." Brandon turned back toward town. "It wasn't about isolation. It was about control. He engineered the situation so she'd have to stop exactly where he wanted her."

They walked back to the library. By the time they returned, it was eight-fifty. A few cars had filled the parking lot. Lights were on inside the building.

Matt checked his watch. "Ten minutes."

Brandon sat on the front steps. The stone was cold through his pants. He watched a school bus drive past, yellow against the gray morning. A dog barked somewhere nearby. Normal sounds in a normal town where something terrible had happened.

At nine o'clock exactly, they climbed the steps and entered the library.

The interior smelled like old books and furniture polish. Wooden floors, high ceilings, tall windows that let in weak daylight. The circulation desk stood directly ahead. To the left, rows of stacks. To the right, a reading area with tables and chairs. A children's section in the back corner, colorful and inviting.

And on the wall near the entrance, a memorial.

Brandon stopped. He hadn't expected this, though he should have. Small towns remembered their own.

A bulletin board with a poster-sized photo of Sarah Carpenter in the center. Candid shot, not the formal ID photo he'd seen in the file. She was laughing at something off-camera, her whole face lit up. Around the photo, people had pinned notes and cards and flowers that had been pressed flat under glass. A small table beneath the board held a condolence book and a jar with fresh carnations.

Brandon approached slowly. Matt hung back, giving him space.

The notes were what you'd expect. *We miss you. You were the best. Heaven gained an angel. Thinking of you always.* Most were dated from April and May of last year, written in the immediate aftermath of her disappearance. A few from summer. One from August.

And one from September. Last month.

Brandon leaned closer. The handwriting was different from the others—smaller, tighter, written with a ballpoint pen instead of marker. Just three words: *I'm so sorry.*

No signature.

Brandon pulled out his phone and took a photo of the note. Then he opened the condolence book. More of the same—messages of grief and remembrance, names he didn't recognize but would need to cross-reference later. Teachers. Classmates. Neighbors. The whole town had signed this book.

He flipped through the pages slowly. Most entries from April. A few scattered through the summer. And on the last page with writing, another unsigned entry: *I think about you every day. I'm sorry I couldn't help you.*

Different handwriting than the note on the board. Or the same person trying to disguise it.

Brandon photographed this page too.

"Can I help you gentlemen?"

He turned. A woman stood behind the circulation desk—late fifties, gray hair cut short, reading glasses on a chain around her neck. She wore a cardigan over a floral dress. Her expression was polite but guarded.

Matt stepped forward, showing his badge. "Special Agents Ellis and Gray, FBI. We called earlier. You must be Mrs. Holcomb."

"Patricia, please." She came around the desk, shaking their hands. Her grip was firm, her palm warm. "I have a meeting room in back where we can talk privately."

Brandon glanced back at the memorial one more time before following her.

The meeting room was small—just a table with six chairs, a whiteboard on one wall, and a window that looked out onto the employee parking lot. Patricia gestured for them to sit and closed the door.

"I've been expecting you," she said, settling into a chair across from them. "Sheriff Garrett called yesterday, said the FBI was taking another look at Sarah's case. I'll help however I can, though I don't know what more I can tell you than I told the deputies last year."

Matt pulled out a notebook. "We appreciate that. Sometimes a fresh perspective can reveal new details. Can you tell us about Sarah? What kind of employee was she?"

Patricia's expression softened. "She was wonderful. Truly. Started here right out of community college, and I honestly don't know what we would have done without her. She was good with the patrons, especially the children. Patient. Kind. Always had time for people."

"What were her responsibilities?" Brandon asked.

"She worked the circulation desk mostly. Checking books in and out, helping people find materials, managing the computer stations. She also ran our children's programs—story time on Saturday mornings, the summer reading club. And she helped with shelving and processing new arrivals."

"So she interacted with a lot of people."

"Every day. We're a small library, but we're busy. People come in for books, internet access, newspapers. Sarah knew most of the regulars by name."

Brandon leaned forward slightly. "Did anyone pay unusual attention to her? Ask personal questions, try to get to know her outside of work?"

Patricia hesitated. Just a fraction of a second, but Brandon caught it.

"There was someone," he said.

She sighed. "Yes. Though I don't know if it means anything. We get all kinds here—lonely people looking for conversation, people who develop... attachments to staff members. It's usually harmless."

"But you noticed something about this person."

"I noticed Sarah started finding excuses to be in the back whenever he came in. That's not like her. She was professional. She didn't avoid patrons." Patricia folded her hands on the table. "His name is Dale Kovacs. He's been coming here for years, always friendly, never caused problems. But about six months before Sarah disappeared, he started coming in more often. And he'd always end up at the circulation desk when Sarah was working."

Matt was writing. "What kind of interactions did they have?"

"Normal ones, on the surface. He'd check out books, chat about the weather, ask for recommendations. But Sarah mentioned to me once that he made her uncomfortable. She couldn't explain why. Just a feeling."

"Did she report it?" Brandon asked.

"To me, yes. I kept an eye on him after that, but I never saw him do anything inappropriate. He was just... there. A lot. And he asked questions."

"What kind of questions?"

"About Sarah's schedule. Whether she'd be working on a particular day. Whether she had a boyfriend. That sort of thing." Patricia's jaw tightened. "I should have done more. Should have talked to him directly, or asked him to use a different library. But I didn't want to make accusations if nothing was actually wrong. Small town—you have to be careful about rumors."

"You couldn't have known," Matt said gently.

Brandon wasn't listening. His attention had shifted to the window behind Patricia. The employee parking lot. The trees. The absence of security cameras.

"Does Dale Kovacs drive a truck?" he asked.

Patricia blinked. "I... yes, I think so. Blue or green, maybe? I don't pay attention to cars, usually."

"When was the last time he came in?"

"Recently, actually. Earlier this week. Maybe Tuesday or Wednesday."

Matt and Brandon exchanged a glance.

"Is he here now?" Brandon asked.

"I don't think so. Let me check the system." Patricia stood and walked to the door. "I'll be right back."

When she was gone, Matt leaned closer. "Kovacs fits the profile. Mid-forties, knew Sarah, made her uncomfortable, drives the right vehicle."

"And he's been in recently," Brandon added. "After the case was reopened."

"Returning to follow the investigation?"

"Or feeling guilty."

Patricia returned a moment later. "He was here yesterday morning. Checked out three books. I have his information pulled up if you need it."

They followed her to the circulation desk. She turned the computer monitor so they could see. Dale Kovacs, 46, address on County Road 275. Current checkouts: *Field Guide to Edible Plants of the Midwest*, *Topographical Maps of Southern Indiana*, and *Wilderness Survival Skills*.

Brandon felt something cold settle in his stomach.

"Can we get a copy of his borrowing history?" Matt asked. "Last six months."

"I'll print it for you."

While Patricia worked the printer, Brandon scanned the library. A few patrons browsed the stacks. An elderly man read a newspaper. Two teenagers worked on homework at a table. And in the far corner, at one of the public computer terminals—

Dale Kovacs.

Brandon's hand moved to Matt's arm, a brief touch. Matt followed his gaze.

Kovacs sat with his back to them, hunched over the screen, wearing a gray hoodie and jeans. Brown hair, receding at the temples. Medium build. From this distance, he looked like anyone. Everyone. Invisible in his ordinariness.

But something was wrong. Brandon couldn't articulate it yet, but the feeling was there—the same instinct that had guided him through dozens of cases. The sense that he was looking at someone who didn't fit quite right in his own skin.

Patricia handed Matt the printout. "Anything else I can do for you?"

"Is there anyone else we should talk to? Other staff who knew Sarah?"

"Amy Chen. She worked the same shifts as Sarah sometimes. They were friendly. She's here today—comes in at ten."

Brandon was still watching Kovacs. "Thank you, Mrs. Holcomb. We'll wait for Amy."

Patricia returned to her desk. Matt moved closer to Brandon.

"That's him?"

"Yes."

"Want to approach now?"

Brandon shook his head slightly. "Not yet. Let's see what he does."

They moved to the reading area, taking seats at a table with a clear sightline to the computer terminals. Brandon picked up a newspaper from the rack, held it open like he was reading. Matt pulled out his phone, appearing to check messages.

Kovacs worked at the computer for another ten minutes. Brandon watched his posture, his movements. The way he hunched forward, shoulders tense. The way his fingers moved across the keyboard—fast, confident. He was searching for something. Or monitoring something.

At nine-forty, Kovacs stood. He logged off the computer and walked toward the circulation desk.

Brandon lowered the newspaper slightly. Now he could see Kovacs's face.

Clean-shaven. Plain features. Nothing remarkable. The kind of face you'd forget five minutes after seeing it.

Except for the eyes. Even from across the room, Brandon could see the way Kovacs looked at Patricia—too direct, too focused. Like he was cataloging her responses, analyzing her body language.

Kovacs said something. Patricia smiled politely and scanned his library card. She handed him a slip of paper—a hold notification, probably. Kovacs thanked her and turned toward the door.

He saw Brandon and Matt.

Just a glance, nothing more. But Brandon saw the recognition flicker across his face. Not recognition of them specifically—they'd never met. Recognition of what they were. Law enforcement. Investigators.

Kovacs's expression didn't change. He walked past their table, nodded politely, and continued toward the exit.

Brandon stood.

"Agent Gray?" Kovacs stopped, turned. His expression was open, curious. "Yes?"

Brandon approached, Matt a step behind. "We're with the FBI. Working on the Sarah Carpenter case."

"Oh." Kovacs's face arranged itself into appropriate sadness. "Terrible thing. I still can't believe it happened. Sarah was such a sweet girl."

"You knew her?"

"Just from the library. I'm here pretty often. She always helped me find what I needed."

"When was the last time you saw her?"

"The night she disappeared, actually." Kovacs shook his head slowly. "I was here that afternoon, and she checked out some books for me. I remember thinking how normal everything seemed. And then the next day, she was gone."

Matt had his notebook out. "Do you remember what time you were here?"

"Maybe around seven? I left before closing. I had to get home for dinner."

"And you didn't see Sarah again that evening?"

"No. I went straight home." Kovacs paused. "Is there a problem? Am I a suspect or something?"

"We're just gathering information," Matt said. "Talking to people who knew Sarah."

"I wish I could help more. I really do. She was a nice person. Whoever did this—" Kovacs's hands clenched briefly, then relaxed. "I hope you catch them."

Brandon watched his face. The expressions were right. The words were right. But something underneath wasn't. Like watching an actor play a role they'd rehearsed too many times.

"One more question," Brandon said. "Do you drive a Chevy Silverado?"

Kovacs blinked. "I do, yes. Dark blue. Why?"

"Just trying to account for vehicles in the area that night. Where were you parked?"

"Out front, I think? Or maybe on the side street. I don't remember specifically—it was over a year ago."

"Of course. Thank you for your time, Mr. Kovacs."

"Sure. Good luck with the investigation." Kovacs nodded to both of them and left.

Through the window, Brandon watched him walk to a truck parked on the side street. Dark blue Silverado, late nineties model. Exactly what the security footage had shown.

Kovacs climbed in, started the engine, and drove away.

Matt stood beside Brandon. "What do you think?"

"I think he's lying."

"About what?"

"I don't know yet." Brandon pulled out his phone and made a note: *Dale Kovacs - watch him*.

A woman's voice behind them: "Can I help you find something?"

They turned. A young Asian woman stood there, mid-twenties, wearing a library staff badge. Amy Chen.

"We're with the FBI," Matt said, showing his badge. "We'd like to ask you some questions about Sarah Carpenter."

Amy's expression crumbled. "Oh. Okay. Yes, of course."

Patricia materialized from somewhere. "You can use the meeting room again."

They followed Amy back to the small room. She sat heavily in a chair, her hands twisting in her lap. Brandon noticed the way she wouldn't make eye contact, the way her shoulders curved inward. Grief, yes. But also guilt.

Matt took the lead. "How long did you work with Sarah?"

"Two years. Since I started here after college." Amy's voice was quiet. "We worked a lot of the same shifts. We weren't best friends or anything, but we were friendly."

"Did she mention anyone making her uncomfortable? Anyone who paid too much attention to her?"

Amy nodded. "There was a guy. Dale something. He came in a lot, and Sarah said he gave her weird vibes. She couldn't explain why. Just that something felt off about him."

"Did you ever interact with him?"

"A few times. He seemed normal to me. Polite, quiet. But Sarah had good instincts about people." Amy's eyes filled. "I should have paid more attention. Should have... I don't know. Been there more."

"This isn't your fault," Matt said.

"Everyone keeps saying that. But the last time I saw her, she asked if I wanted to get dinner after work that Thursday. And I said no because I had a date. If I'd said yes, if I'd been with her, maybe—"

"You couldn't have known," Brandon said. His voice was quiet but firm. "The person responsible is the only one at fault."

Amy wiped her eyes. "I just want someone to find her. To bring her home. Her mom—Mrs. Carpenter—she just wants to know what happened. That's all."

Brandon thought about the memorial board. The unsigned notes. The weight of unanswered questions.

"Did Sarah ever mention wanting to leave Thorndale?" he asked. "Going back to school, moving away?"

Amy looked up, surprised. "Yeah. She was thinking about it. She wanted to study library science, maybe become a librarian at a university somewhere. She was saving money. She just needed a little more time."

Time she never got.

They talked for another twenty minutes. Amy provided names of other regulars, described Sarah's routine, confirmed that Dale Kovacs had been increasingly present in the months before the abduction. When they were done, Amy stood slowly.

"Do you think you'll find her?" she asked.

Matt's expression was kind but honest. "We're going to try."

After Amy left, Brandon and Matt sat in silence for a moment.

"Kovacs is our primary suspect," Matt said. "Everything points to him."

"Too much points to him." Brandon stared at the window. "It's too neat."

"Sometimes it is neat. Sometimes the obvious answer is the right answer."

"Maybe." Brandon stood and walked to the window. The parking lot was empty except for staff vehicles. Beyond the trees, he could see a sliver of the residential street. Normal houses. Normal lives.

One of those houses probably belonged to someone who knew exactly what had happened to Sarah Carpenter.

"I want to see his property," Brandon said. "County Road 275. See if anything stands out."

"We'll need a warrant to search."

"I don't want to search. Just drive by. Look."

Matt checked his watch. "It's ten-thirty. We should check in with the sheriff, see if they've made any progress on the truck owner list."

Brandon nodded but didn't move from the window. His mind was working through the timeline, the evidence, the psychology. Dale Kovacs fit the profile. Made Sarah uncomfortable. Drove the right truck. Had been here that day. Had the knowledge to tamper with her car. Asked questions about her. Returned to the library after the case was reopened.

But something was wrong. Some piece didn't fit.

"The memorial," Brandon said suddenly. "The unsigned notes."

"You think Kovacs wrote them?"

"Maybe. Or someone else who feels guilty." He turned to face Matt. "Someone who knew something and didn't speak up. Or someone who helped."

"An accomplice?"

"Or a witness who kept quiet."

They left the meeting room and walked back through the library. Brandon paused again at Sarah's memorial. The smiling photo. The messages from people who missed her. The flowers that someone kept fresh.

He took out his phone and photographed the entire board, zooming in on each note, each card, each detail.

When he stepped back, Matt was watching him.

"You okay?"

Brandon looked at his partner. Matt's expression held genuine concern. After three years working together, Matt had learned to read his moods, his silences, his withdrawal into himself when a case hit too close.

"I will be," Brandon said. "When we find her."

They walked outside into the cold morning. The sky had darkened. Rain was coming.

Brandon stood on the library steps and looked south down Main Street, toward Route 39, toward the Crossroads three miles away. He thought about Sarah Carpenter making this drive every Thursday, her routine so predictable that someone had learned it, studied it, exploited it.

He thought about Missouri. About a payphone and a boyfriend who couldn't get there in time. About an eight-year-old boy who didn't understand why his brother wouldn't talk about that night.

He thought about all the people who disappeared and never came home.

"Let's go," he said. "I want to see where Kovacs lives."

They got in the car. Brandon drove, his hands steady on the wheel, his mind already mapping the route, calculating distances, imagining scenarios.

Somewhere in this small town, Sarah Carpenter's body was waiting to be found.

And somewhere in this small town, Dale Kovacs was waiting too.

Waiting to see if they'd figure it out in time.
